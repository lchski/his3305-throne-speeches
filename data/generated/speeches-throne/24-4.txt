Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I greet you as you resume your parliamentary duties.
In the course of tjie year I have travelled through our country from ocean to ocean and have been happy to observe everywhere the fealty and devotion of all Canadians to the crown.
We meet in a world of continued international tension which has prompted my government to redouble its efforts to bring about a general acceptance of peaceful means of settling disputes. It has reaffirmed its readiness to co-operate in the United Nations and elsewhere in the development of conditions that would lead to the attainment of this goal. My prime minister and other representatives of the government have stated forcefully the views of Canada on these matters and they have received widespread support from the Canadian people.
The commonwealth has continued to demonstrate its vitality. Nigeria was welcomed to full commonwealth membership at the beginning of last month and additional new members will enter this coming year. Continuing constitutional development in the commonwealth is likely to be considered at a, prime ministers' conference in 1961.
Disarmament under international control is the key to an enduring world peace. My government has accordingly maintained its unremitting efforts to achieve progress in this field. Until such time as disarmament under effective control can be achieved, however, it is necessary to ask you to maintain well-trained and well-armed Canadian defence forces, adequate to meet Canada's defence obligations. My ministers will reaffirm Canada's support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a defensive alliance dedicated to maintaining the peace.
. The unanimous approval given by the United Nations to a joint resolution embodying the essence of the Canadian proposal for a United Nations food bank is a matter for satisfaction.
Important international tariff negotiations began in September in Geneva and will last well into next year; my ministers have made clear that these negotiations should be used as a means of finding solutions to the current European trade problems in a manner that will not harm the interests of other trading nations.
Important conferences with the provincial governments have taken place in recent months. In accordance with the objective expressed by the prime minister early in your last sessioh, two meetings have been held at which progress has been made in discussion of means of amending the constitution of Canada in Canada and relieving the parliament at Westminster of its residual responsibility in regard to the British North America Act. Further meetings have been arranged. Two conferences on fiscal arrangements have been held and further exchanges of views will take place. You will in due course be asked to approve legislation concerning dominion-provincial fiscal arrangements for the period commencing April .1962. 
At the present time Canada's foreign trade is at a record level and exports to the United Kingdom and commonwealth countries have shown a remarkable increase this year. Economic expansion has also had the result that more Canadians have been employed this year than in any previous year and labour income is at an all-time high. The government recognizes, however, the necessity of continuing the expansion of the national economy at a pace sufficient to provide jobs for the record numbers who are now entering the labour force, as well as jobs for those who are displaced by automation and other technological changes.
Accordingly you will be asked to approve measures designed to increase immediate employment opportunities and also measures which will constitute a large further instalment in the long range program of national development.
Among the first measures, the government has already announced its intention of seeking your approval of another and larger program of assistance to municipalities for winter works projects; this announcement has already given rise to intense efforts across Canada in which all levels of government are joining. My ministers have also expressed their intention of carrying out all possible federal works during the winter. In recommending approval of these programs to you, my ministers are confident that provinces and municipalities, business and labour, and all citizens will co-operate in a continuing effort to put more Canadians to work.
With a view to avoiding any interruption in the building of urgently needed hospitals, it is deemed appropriate to announce now the intention of the government to recommend to parliament that the federal grants for hospital construction be continued for a further five-year period after the expiration of the present period in March 1963.
Another special winter housing program has been undertaken; the terms of housing and home improvements loans have been modified within the National Housing Act to encourage additional building activity; in addition, you will be asked to amend the act to make further improvement in the terms of mortgage lending. You will also be asked, as a means of providing low rent housing more economically, and counteracting urban blight, to authorize the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, in partnership with provincial authorities, to undertake the purchase, improvement and rental of existing housing in specified areas of urban redevelopment, just as such partnerships now build and rent new housing units.
The housing legislation put before you will also contain provisions to authorize the corporation to make loans to universities for students' residences on terms similar to those of loans made for limited dividend housing projects.
The pollution of Canada's water supplies is a serious problem confronting many communities; its correction or prevention involves substantial further investment in sound urban development. It will therefore be proposed to you that the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation be authorized to make long term loans to local authorities for approved projects for sewage disposal and treatment, up to two thirds of the costs of such projects, on terms similar to those of loans for limited dividend housing projects. As a special incentive for prompt action on this urgent problem, parliament will be asked to authorize the crown to write off one quarter of the amount of any such loan expended on work done before April 1963.

Believing that the ultimate success of efforts to improve Canada's trade and employment and the standard of living of Canadian workers depends largely upon increasing Canadian productivity, my ministers will ask you to authorize the establishment of a productivity council. Its membership would include Canadians from the fields of industry and commerce, organized labour, agriculture and other primary production, as well as qualified individuals chosen from the public at large and from the scientific agencies of government. The purpose of this council would be to strengthen Canada's competitive position in export and domestic markets by improving the productivity of primary and secondary industries.
You will also be asked to give early consideration to a bill authorizing government guarantees for bank loans to small businesses to finance additions and improvements to their business premises and equipment. My ministers are convinced that additional medium term credit facilities for small businesses would enable many private projects to go forward this winter all across Canada, providing substantial additional employment. Moreover, this addition to our credit legislation will constitute a continuing stimulus to the growth of Canadian private enterprise.
A bill will also be laid before you to extend the assistance given to provincial governments for vocational training, both in the school system and in the training and retraining of those who have already become workers. With more advanced technology in industry and the need to increase productivity, better technical training of the youth of Canada is required and more retraining of Canadian workers who have to transfer to other jobs or trades. This is particularly necessary in those areas where job opportunities in traditional industries are limited. In order to get this program under way quickly, you will be asked to approve grants of 75 per cent of the amounts expended, up to March 31, 1963, in building approved technical schools or training institutions.
Amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act will be placed before you to safeguard the basic purpose of the act, to strengthen the fund and to correct abuses which have developed in practice.
As an additional step in the national agricultural program, you will also be asked to approve enabling legislation to authorize the federal government to join with provincial authorities and local groups throughout Canada in comprehensive programs of rural rehabilitation and development. My ministers believe that as farming is a basic Canadian industry it must be made more stable and remunerative. Widening the uses of Canada's farm lands and water resources will be necessary for this purpose.
Among other measures in the long range program, you will be requested to approve a number of major projects of national development. The largest of these will be the development of the water power on the Columbia river. Agreement has been reached with the government of the United States on a plan for the co-operative development of the use of these waters and a treaty will be submitted to you for approval in due course. You will also be asked to take the action necessary to fulfil Canada's part in implementing it.
You will be requested to approve several projects of railway development in opening up Canada's frontier. One of these will be a Canadian National Railway line to the new mining area near Matta-gami lake in northwestern Quebec, which will aid in the rapid expansion of the mineral industry of that great province.
You will be asked to appropriate funds to enable a detailed survey to be made of the western route for the railway from northern Alberta to Great Slave lake.
Other major projects for which appropriations will be requested include a floodway to protect the city of Winnipeg and nearby communities and works to conserve and control the waters of the upper Thames river in southwestern Ontario.
My government has decided that the modernization of the Customs Tariff of Canada, on which much has been accomplished in recent years, should be substantially accelerated. To make this feasible on a sound and fair basis, you will be asked to enlarge the tariff board and authorize it to sit in two panels.
You will also be asked to revise the definition in the Customs Tariff of goods of a class or kind made in Canada.
It is the intention of my Minister of Finance to present a supplementary budget to you before the Christmas recess.
You will be invited to consider means by which to encourage a greater participation by Canadians in the ownership and control of industry and resources in Canada.
You will be asked to approve legislation requiring the disclosure of information by business and labour organizations in Canada controlled from outside Canada.
You will be asked to amend legislation to enlarge the investment and other powers of insurance companies.
Amendments to the Pensions Act will be recommended, which will include substantial increases in the pensions payable to veterans or their dependants.
You will also be asked to consider means of encouraging the youth of Canada in amateur athletics.
A bill to revise the Civil Service Act will again be submitted for your approval. A bill to revise the Immigration Act will be laid before you. You will also be asked to revise the Penitentiaries Act to bring it into accord with my minister's policies of correctional reform. Amendments will be proposed to the Criminal Code having to do with capital punishment and with the treatment of criminal sexual psychopaths.
It is considered desirable to provide for broader representation on the board of directors of the Canadian National Railway; legislation will be introduced to increase the number of directors accordingly.
Amendments to the Canada Shipping Act will be proposed.
Other legislation and amendments to a number of other statutes will also be proposed. Several special committees will be re-established.
Members of the House of Commons:
The estimates of amounts required for the public service and the payments authorized by parliament will be laid before you. These will include an appropriation for the work of the royal commission on government organization which has been recently established to recommend improvements in the organization and methods of operation of the departments and agencies of the government which it thinks will best promote efficiency, economy and improved service in the dispatch of public business.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons;
May divine Providence bless you and guide you.
