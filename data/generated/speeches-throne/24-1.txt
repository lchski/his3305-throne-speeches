Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It is my pleasure to welcome you to this first session of the twenty-fourth parliament of Canada. We all recall with pleasure the historic events of last autumn when Her Gracious Majesty was present to open parliament herself and to receive the warm welcome and wide acclaim of her Canadian subjects. We look forward to the presence this summer of Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret to take part in the centennial ceremonies of British Columbia and to visit other parts of Canada.
As further evidence of the expanding sense of mutual interest among the countries of the commonwealth as well as the growth of the commonwealth itself, it is pleasing and significant that we will be welcoming to Canada this summer both the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister of Ghana.
My ministers have been glad to note the widely expressed desire of the peoples of many nations that the manifold advances of science shall be devoted to the betterment of mankind rather than to the arts and engines of war. My government will continue to make unremitting efforts to assist in the peaceful solution of international problems and in the accomplishment by patient negotiation of a substantial measure of disarmament. In the meantime, my advisers will ask your support to maintain, in co-operation with our allies, armed forces adequate to deter any potential aggression.
My government believes that the condition of international economic affairs is such as to require major concerted efforts to encourage the expansion of trade. It is accordingly very gratifying that all countries of the commonwealth have accepted the proposal of Canada that a commonwealth trade and economic conference be held in September of this year in Montreal.
We look forward with pleasure to the visits to Canada this summer of the President of the United States and the President of the Federal Republic of Germany. My ministers welcome the opportunities which these visits will afford for useful conversations.
My government regrets to have to report that efforts to avert a strike of firemen on the Canadian Pacific Railway were unsuccessful. It is however encouraging to note that negotiations which my ministers arranged between the parties have succeeded in narrowing the issues in dispute to the point where further direct discussions may yet resolve the question. My government continues to maintain a constant watch over developments in this situation and will be ready in the light of events to recommend such action as the national interest demands and circumstances may require.
My government will propose to you the enactment of a bill of rights to safeguard the rights of all persons in Canada in respect of all subjects within the jurisdiction of parliament.
You will be asked to approve a number of measures and appropriations to continue and extend the program of my government in sustaining employment by the acceleration of useful public works and by encouraging the development and processing of our natural resources.
You will be asked immediately to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act in order to extend for a further six weeks, during the current year, the period during which special seasonal benefits may be paid. Already the amendments to this act made in November last and those made to the Unemployment Assistance Act have proven their value in mitigating the difficulties of Canadians who are temporarily without jobs. Further amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act will be proposed at a later stage in the session.
My government will continue to promote a vigorous program of house building, which has already proven to be a strong feature of our economy and which constitutes the best opportunity for increased work in meeting the needs of our people. My ministers are ready to co-operate fully under the authority of the National Housing Act in further projects for slum clearance and urban redevelopment to improve the cities and towns of Canada.
In order to ensure the continuation of our national housing program, you will be asked at an early date to approve an increase in the public funds made available under the National Housing Act.
You will be asked to make provision for a substantial program of public investment to be carried out by government departments and crown companies and to provide assistance to provincial governments for certain agreed types of projects. In particular, a large expansion in the construction and equipment of our system of airports and airways will be proposed and an increase in our work on harbours and rivers and public buildings.
In order to promote our national development on the frontier in the north you will be asked to authorize the construction of a railway to Great Slave lake. My ministers regard this as a major step in the establishment of productive industry on an economic basis in the Northwest Territories. You will also be asked to provide for the construction of important roads needed for development in the Yukon and Northwest Territories and in the provinces, with the co-operation of their governments. You will be asked to provide for the initiation of a program of research to assist in opening up the mineral resources of our Arctic islands.
My ministers have made progress in arrangements for the construction of the South Saskatchewan project. Proposals will be placed before you to make possible the commencement, this year,
of the construction of the main dam intended to create a great reservoir in the heart of the prairie in order to further the productive development of this part of Canada.
The easing of the stringency in the capital markets of Canada during the past eight months encourages confidence in the expectation that large programs of public investment can be successfully financed not only by my government and its agencies but also by provincial governments and municipalities. My ministers remain mindful of the importance of financing their large program of expenditures in such manner as will best safeguard against a recurrence of inflationary dangers in future. They wish to urge upon all groups in our society a recognition of the dangers and inequities of inflation and the need to restrain demands which will give rise to increases in prices and the costs of production.
The improvements in our financial relations with the provinces made by the last parliament are having a beneficial effect upon our economy bymaking it possible for provincial governments and their municipalities to proceed with greater confidence upon expanded programs of necessary services and works.
There will be placed before you a proposal to establish a new agency to regulate broadcasting in Canada and to ensure that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the privately owned broadcasting stations work effectively together to constitute a national system to provide satisfactory television and radio services to all Canadians within reach. Related amendments to the Radio Act will also be proposed.
To promote and guide the proper long-term development of our national capital region upon lines worthy of our nation, my government will request you to enact a new national capital act to replace the present Federal District Commission Act.
Changes will be proposed in the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act to make certain that payments may be made to participating provinces qualifying under the act in respect of any periods commencing after June this year.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a harbour commission to combine the growing harbours at Fort William and Port Arthur and to fit this lakehead harbour to handle the larger traffic to be expected as a result of the seaway.
Unremitting efforts are being made to sell Canadian agricultural and fisheries products in the markets of the world and considerably larger exports of wheat and cattle have been made. Support prices have now been established for a considerable number of products under the Agricultural Stabilization Act to carry into effect, for the current year, the desire of parliament that agriculture should be thus assisted to realize fair returns for its labour and investment.
The act to provide cash advances on farm-stored grain has proven to be of advantage to a large number of farmers and to the economy as a whole. Certain amendments will be proposed to that act in the light of experience in its application.
Amendments will also be proposed to the Prairie Farm Assistance Act and the Canadian Farm Loan Act.
In order to assist small business, there will be established a small business section within the administrative machinery of government. The functions of this organization will be to provide liaison between the government and small businesses, to study the problems of small business and to advise on measures necessary to meet them.
You will be asked to replace the present Ticket of Leave Act with a new statute to establish a national parole board. There will be submitted for 

your consideration amendments to the Citizenship Act and the Indian Act to eliminate certain discriminatory provisions in these statutes.
Amendments will be proposed to the Veterans Insurance Act, the Returned Soldiers Insurance Act, the Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act, the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act, the Transport Act, the National Parks Act and a number of other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and payments approved by parliament.
My ministers will lay before you in accordance with the law the special warrants which I issued upon their advice to authorize expenditures urgently required for the public good during the period since the twenty-third parliament was dissolved. You will be invited to consider and approve these expenditures. An amendment to the Financial Administration Act will be proposed relating to the use of special warrants.
Other measures will be proposed to improve the effectiveness of the processes of parliament.
The government will ask your approval of the installation in the House of Commons of a system of simultaneous translation.
You will be asked to set up a select committee on broadcasting, a standing committee on estimates and a standing committee on veterans affairs, all with power to send for persons and papers. My ministers will propose that a member of Her Majesty's loyal opposition be elected chairman of the committee on public accounts.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Commons:
May divine Providence bless and guide you in the accomplishment of the high purpose which brings you here.
