Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I am happy to greet you as we meet for the first time at the opening of our parliament.
My appointment as the representative of Her Majesty the Queen in Canada is an honour which moves me profoundly. I invoke divine help to

Speech from the Throne guide and strengthen me that I may serve well the parliament and people of Canada in carrying out the trust confided to me by the sovereign.
We will long cherish the memories of the presence of our gracious queen and of his royal highness among us last summer. The warmth of the welcome given them throughout the country is an expression of the loyalty, devotion and affection of all Canadians. Our attachment to the crown is a great unifying force. It will be my earnest endeavour to foster a spirit of harmony and confidence in all, irrespective of race or creed, in the achievement of our mighty destiny.
My prime minister looks forward to meeting with the leaders of the other commonwealth governments early in May. The commonwealth is in a state of rapid constitutional development. During the course of the year Nigeria is to become an independent member following those constructive processes by which the commonwealth has set a lead in peaceful evolution of new nations from dependent territories.
We welcome the spirit which has made possible the progress of the past year in meetings between the leaders of great nations and we believe that with wisdom and patience the series of meetings arranged to commence in Paris in May can bring about the results which all desire. Canada will be prepared to assist wholeheartedly by consultation, particularly in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with those immediately involved in these efforts to achieve just diplomatic settlements.
A lasting peace between nations, founded upon understanding and tolerance, is the strongest aspiration of Canadians. The government continues to regard as a primary goal the achievement of the greatest possible measure of controlled disarmament. Canada will devote every effort to discharging its responsibilities as a member of the ten nation disarmament committee. Some progress has already been made by those nations possessing nuclear weapons in preparing a treaty to discontinue the testing of such weapons and to establish a system of international control.
We are heartened by the unanimous approval given by the United Nations to the Canadian proposal to sample and analyse more widely and effectively the radioactive content of the atmosphere, soil and food. For this purpose necessary funds to enable Canada to take a leading part in this work will be requested.
It must be expected that the recent technological advances in the penetration of outer space will lead to further dramatic developments. Canada welcomes the opportunity to participate actively in the United Nations committee intended to ensure that outer space is used only for peaceful purposes.
Economic and technical assistance to the less developed nations of the world continues to be needed both on humanitarian grounds and to provide the economic basis for peaceful and orderly progress in those nations. You will therefore be asked to continue programs of aid to other, less developed nations, particularly those in the commonwealth. You will also be asked to vote support for the program of scholarships and fellowships to be exchanged within the commonwealth adopted at the suggestion of Canada.
Substantial progress has now been made in finding a satisfactory basis for the development of the power of the Columbia river in co-operation with the United States and negotiations for this purpose have now been initiated with the government of the United States. The results will be placed before parliament for approval and for the authority to take the measures necessary to bring about the full use of this most valuable source of power. The government of Canada remains ready to participate with British Columbia in the joint development of the potentials of this great river.

International trade is one of the chief bases of Canadian prosperity and must continue to be a
major interest of this parliament. The growing exports of various countries are presenting us with both increasing opportunities for trade and problems of competition. Developments of far-reaching importance to Canada's trade are now taking place in Europe, and two of my ministers are in Paris today consulting on these subjects with representatives of other nations.
Canada's general economic position has greatly improved during 1959 and the prospects for 1960 are favourable. The recurrent problem of seasonal unemployment remains, however, but apart from this, expansion in production and employment has been general across the nation.
My government is pleased that its national development program has stimulated a large increase in northern exploration. Last year's discovery of oil and gas in the Yukon is being followed this year by a score of new exploratory wells over a wide area of northern Canada. Coupled with a revival of mining activity, this makes it evident that private enterprise is now active in the opening up of the north. New oil and gas regulations will emphasize opportunities for Canadians to participate in the ownership of these northern resources.
The securing to farmers of a fair share of the national income, through the maintenance of prices of farm products, has received constant attention and continues to be a matter of prime concern to my government. Our farms have yielded surpluses which have necessitated a revision of existing measures to stabilize farm prices to ensure that their basic purpose is achieved without the wasteful accumulation of surplus stocks. The severe, unseasonal snow in the prairie provinces interrupted the harvest rendering necessary emergency legislation which will be considered at the earliest possible opportunity.
Legislation to provide for a Canadian bill of rights will be placed before you for your approval.
My ministers have had under consideration the enactment of a provision that would enable the establishment of a uniform retirement age of 75 for all judges appointed under the authority of the parliament of Canada. Agreement has now been reached with all provincial governments on this principle. You will accordingly be asked to approve a resolution leading to an appropriate amendment to the British North America Act, and you will then be asked to make consequential amendments to the Judges Act.
Bills will also be submitted for your approval to give added status and responsibility to the territorial councils of the Yukon and Northwest Territories and to improve the administration of justice in the territories.
Amendments to the Combines Investigation Act and the related provisions of the Criminal Code will be laid before you to clarify and improve this act and protect the interests of small business firms.
You will be requested to revise the Civil Service Act and a special committee of the House of Commons will be proposed for the consideration of the bill. Amendments to the Public Service Superannuation Act will also be placed before you.
An amendment will be proposed to the Federal-Provincial Tax-Sharing Arrangements Act to extend, for the two remaining fiscal years covered by that act, the increase in the share of the revenue from the personal income tax that is allocated to the provinces. You will also be asked to authorize, for any provinces which desire them, alternative arrangements in respect of university grants.

Legislation will be introduced to give Indians
the franchise in federal elections. You will be invited to re-establish the joint committee on Indian affairs.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a new department to be concerned with affairs relating to the forests of Canada and their most effective utilization and conservation, and to assume responsibility for other related resources.
You will be requested to extend for three years the operation of the Emergency Gold Mining Assistance Act.
An amendment will also be proposed to the National Energy Board Act authorizing the temporary extension of the licences for the export of electricity until the board can conclude its urgent business on export of gas.
A proposal will be placed before you to extend the period during which payments may be made in respect of construction of the trans-Canada highway. You will also be asked to continue the operation of the Export and Import Permits Act for another three years. The repeal of the Newfoundland Fisheries Board Act will be proposed.
Measures will be placed before you to amend the Old Age Security Act and the Veterans' Allowance Act to establish a basis for the payment of pensions and allowances, respectively, to Canadians residing outside Canada.
You will be asked to authorize the establishment of harbour commissions for the harbours of Nanaimo and Oshawa, and to amend the Windsor Harbour Commissioners Act.
You will also be requested to revise the Feeding Stuffs Act and to amend the National Housing Act, the Expropriation Act, the Department of Justice Act and certain other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and payments authorized by parliament. To assist you in this purpose, the committee on estimates will again be requested to review the expenditures of several departments.
You will be invited to re-establish the special committee on broadcasting so that it may continue its consideration of broadcasting policy, particularly in the field of regulation and licensing.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the Commons:
May divine Providence bless you and guide you in your duties.
