Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the Second Session of the 30th Parliament of Canada.
I am proud to be able to speak with you once more after an absence occasioned by an affliction which forced my withdrawal from public life for a time.
I now have a better understanding of our human frailty, but I have also learned the depths of devotion of those who love us as well as the strength of the human will to survive.
I would like to take this opportunity to offer my thanks to all my fellow citizens who sent their best wishes for my health and who remembered me in their prayers.
The activities of this year have taken me from the grounds of Rideau Hall and across the country. Two of my engagements took me to Vancouver, for the United Nations Habitat conference, and to Montreal, for the Olympic Games.
The whole world was our guest for these two events, and I was struck by the contrast between those of us in Canada who are sometimes inflicted with morbid self-analysis, and those who come to us from other lands, and see Canada as a country truly blessed.

For the Olympic Games, the Queen and her family came to Quebec and Ontario, after a visit by Her Majesty and Prince Philip to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; everywhere they received a warm welcome.
Next year, of course, Her Majesty will celebrate the Silver Jubilee of her accession to the Throne. She will be spending a few days in Ottawa to celebrate it with us, and to celebrate also the Jubilee of the appointment of the First Canadian-born Governor General in Canada, and the 10th anniversary of the foundation of the Order of Canada. This will be the seventh time in ten years that the Queen has visited Canada.
As we assemble in this historic place the day after Thanksgiving Day, it is Fitting for all of us to pause and give thanks for the remarkable freedom we enjoy as Canadians, and for those human and natural resources which give Canada a favoured position among the nations of the world.
Because of the basic underlying strength of the economy, and because of the co-operation of the majority of Canadians which is making the anti-inflation program work, Canada has better reasons for confidence and optimism than has virtually any other nation. Our storehouse of natural resources, our food-producing ability, our labour and management skills present Canada with growth opportunities which are shared by few other industrialized countries. The fundamental reality which will guide our deliberations is that Canada is entering upon a decade of opportunity.
It is our strength, and our conFidence in ourselves which give us the real opportunity to make greater progress toward those goals which all Canadians share-national unity, equality of opportunity, and the enhancement of individual rights.
I-National Unity
In order to promote that level of unity among Canadians without which we cannot be truly free, truly one nation, nor hope to achieve our shared national goals, the Government will place a very high priority upon the promotion of better understanding among French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians, and upon the achievement of formal constitutional independence.
Since 1968 the policy of ofFicial languages, supported by all parties represented in Parliamnt, has been based on the principle of equality, and on the right of Canadians to speak English or French according to their own will. An essential consequence, agreed by Parliament, is that the federal government provide services in the two official languages in the National Capital, and wherever else there is sufficient demand for such services.

The policy is one of fairness and reasonableness toward the people speaking the two official languages of Canada; and the Government is of the view that it must be maintained in the interests of justice and of the unity of Canada.
Canada is a diverse country. Unity can result only from a recognition of that diversity, and not from any attempt to impose rigid uniformity. In matters of language and culture, it is important to recognize the personality of the various parts of the country without departing from fundamental principles of justice and generosity, which should apply everywhere.
The Government has established programs intended to give real meaning to the official languages policy. Some of these measures have proven successful, and will be continued. Others have not, and will be modified.
Grievances originating from public servants through the Commissioner of Official Languages will continue to be reviewed, in order to fulfill the Government's commitment to ensure maximum fairness and effectiveness in the implementation of the official languages policy.
The Government remains committed to the enhancement of the bilingual capacity of the federal public service. However, it believes that a better balance should be established between the money spent to introduce bilingualism in the public service and the money spent to enable more Canadians, particularly young people, to learn to communicate in both official languages. The Government is convinced that a great majority of Canadians are dedicated to the strengthening of bonds among Canadians speaking our two official languages, and belonging to our many different cultures.

Canadians appear particularly anxious that their children have the best possible chance of understanding their compatriots of the other language. Consequently, the Government intends to discuss with the provinces arrangements to increase the effectiveness of training in both official languages in the school systems across Canada.
The Government also intends to increase programs to enable young people from various parts of the country to learn more about one another.
II-Equality of Opportunity
While it is essential to national unity that all Canadians believe we have an equal opportunity to be fully ourselves in a cultural sense, it is just as essential to unity that we enjoy equal opportunities for individual and regional economic fulfilment.
To translate Canada's economic potential into real growth and equality of opportunity, we must be both clear-sighted in our recognition of the obstacles which lie in our path, and united in our determination to remove them.
The most important obstacle is inflation; a destructive force which we all know can take jobs and income away from our workers, rob the elderly of the value of their savings, stunt the dreams of families for a better life, impede the flow of capital necessary for industrial growth, and obstruct the fight against poverty and inequality.
The continued reduction of inflation, and the creation of many more employment opportunities for Canadians, are and will continue to be the Government's highest priorities.
To create the climate necessary for the achievement of these two vital objectives, the Government will continue to practise fiscal restraint. The control of inflation will remain the single most important condition for economic stability in Canada, even after price and income controls are removed. Determined restraint in fiscal and monetary policy is essential to the long-term control of inflation.
The Government remains committed to a reduction in the growth of the public service. In the ten years prior to 1975-76 authorized man-years in the public service grew at an average annual rate of 4 per cent. This year the growth rate was reduced to 1.5 per cent, requiring actual reductions in 27 departments and agencies. The Government will reduce the rate of growth to below one per cent in the coming fiscal year.
In a further effort to reduce the size of government as well as expand the range of opportunities for private enterprise, all federal programs will be reviewed to identify those government activities which could be transferred to the private sector without reducing the quality of service to the public.
The international trading environment will profoundly influence our economic performance, and significant progress will be sought by Canada in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations and through other trade development initiatives. To support private industry in meeting greater international competition, the Government will modify substantially its industrial assistance programs.

The Government also places a very high value on the contribution small businesses make to the economic and social well-being of Canadians. Small owner-managed firms are a mainstay of employment in cities and towns across the country. They supply goods and services essential to consumers and to other business, and they demonstrate the innovation and entrepreneurship from which successful enterprise must spring. More than that, small businesses, and the people who own them, manage them, and work in them, are the economic backbone of countless communities throughout Canada.
The Government will introduce measures to assist small businesses by improving local access to financial assistance and other services provided by government departments, the Federal Business Development Bank, and Financial institutions in the private sector.
In response to concerns expressed by many Canadian businessmen, the Government will establish a better balance between the need for economic data, and the paperwork burden thereby imposed on small firms. The number of firms required to make statistical reports to government will be substantially reduced. Those larger companies which will still be required to submit information on a regular basis will be able to do so on fewer and simpler reporting forms.
In pursuit of the goal of a higher rate of employment, it will be necessary to improve the efficiency of the labour market and actively hasten the return of unemployed workers to productive effort. Adequate income is a pre-requisite to human dignity; and the Government believes most unemployed Canadians would much prefer to secure that income through worthwhile work than through public assistance. In some cases, and locations, this goal can be achieved only through direct job creation by governments.
You will therefore be asked to approve a comprehensive, year-round, direct job creation program, directed particularly toward areas of chronic high unemployment. Other programs will provide more job opportunities and improved employment counselling for young people.
The Government will not compete with the private sector for the services of unemployed workers, but will create jobs in areas where its efforts will be a necessary supplement to private sector activity.
You will be asked to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act in ways which will permit insurance funds to be used to maintain the income of Canadians being trained for new jobs, and to help employers retain workers who might otherwise be temporarily laid off.
To facilitate these improvements, the Government proposes the merger of the operations of the Unemployment Insurance Commission and the Manpower and Immigration Department, so that Canadians may obtain employment support services at a single source.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Immigration Act, designed to promote Canada's regional and urban development goals, promote family unity, achieve a balance between immigration levels and employment opportunities, and preserve Canada's reputation as an open, tolerant society which welcomes the energy and cultural diversity of people from all parts of the world.

The improvement of labour-management relations in Canada is an essential pre-condition to economic stability. While it considers the collective bargaining system to be one of the important ways of ensuring fair wages in a democratic society, the Government and Canadians generally are deeply disturbed by the loss of productivity and increased social tensions which frequently result from the inadequacies of that system.
The solution is not to be found in excessive restriction of collective bargaining rights, but rather in the development of better mechanisms for settling disputes in a less adversarial, more co-operative manner.
The Government therefore intends to work with the provinces and with labour and business communities to develop a number of initiatives aimed at improving labour-management relations.
It is intended to establish a collective bargaining information centre, which will offer objective economic and compensation data to all parties. It is also intended to encourage greater participation by plant workers in decisions affecting their working conditions; to expand labour education programs; to develop a
voluntary code of fair practices; and to establish a national institution dedicated to improving the quality of life in the workplace.
An industrial safety and health centre will be established to assist companies and workers in their efforts to identify and remove hazards.
The Government will work closely with its own employees in various departments and Crown corporations to implement innovative, co-operative methods of improving health and safety conditions. In effect, the Government intends to use its own operations to test new methods of improving working conditions and labour-management relations.

Measures will be proposed to improve the collective bargaining system in the public service, to reduce the adversarial nature of the process and to ensure an equitable relationship between compensation levels in the public and private sectors.
The Government intends to promote greater freedom and efficiency in the marketplace, and thus reinforce the market system's vital role in the allocation of national resources among national needs.
Significant revisions to laws promoting competition in the marketplace will be placed before you. The Government is determined to preserve and enhance Canada's traditional policy of reliance on individual enterprise as the mainspring of economic activity.
The focus of the second stage of competition policy reform will be a strengthening of the laws governing mergers and monopolies in order to encourage a more efficient and dynamic economy; one that rewards the creative and the industrious; that allows prices to be determined by the free play of market forces while protecting the marketplace from excessive concentrations of power. The more effectively competition governs the marketplace, the less necessity there will be for detailed regulation and control of the economy by governments.
On the other hand, where competition is inadequate the Government must intervene to protect the public interest. For this reason, changes will be introduced to the National Transportation Act to protect against unfair freight rates.
There is a growing awareness among Canadians of the need for more careful conservation of vital energy resources such as petroleum and natural gas. The Government will place further emphasis on research and development of renewable energy sources and on means of improving the efficiency with which energy is used in Canada, particularly the thermal efficiency of residential and commercial buildings.
To ensure responsible development of our indigenous resources, the Government intends to introduce measures to regulate exploration and development on federal lands.
With a view to conserving the food resources of the sea, and improving the livelihood of Canadian fishermen, the Government will proclaim by the first of January its extended jurisdiction over waters within two hundred miles of our coastline.
As a further element of the Government's food policy, measures will be introduced to make more farm-stored crops eligible for advance payments. The Government will also work with the provinces and farm organizations to strengthen the structure and productivity of Canadian agriculture.

In the field of social policy, extensive federal-provincial discussions over the past three years have resulted in a new framework for the sharing of costs and for making social service programs more responsive. Parliament will therefore be asked to consider a new Social Services Act which will substantially improve the effectiveness of cost-shared social services in Canada, especially for the aged, children and the handicapped.
In response to the need for good day-care services everywhere in Canada, the Government will help to provide more and better day-care services by encouraging the provincial governments to adopt a new system of fees related to incomes. A great many more Canadian mothers who seek employment outside the home will thereby be free to do so, because partially subsidized day-care will be more widely available.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the Canada Pension Plan which would further recognize the value of the contribution made to the family and society by both marriage partners, in the event that one remains at home to raise children while their partner works outside the home, or in the event of marriage breakdown.
On January first, the indexing of family allowance payments will be resumed to compensate for the rise in the cost of living during 1976.
In the areas of medical insurance, hospital insurance and post-secondary education, negotiations will continue with the provinces concerning the gradual introduction of new Financial and administrative arrangements. These changes would not only allow the provinces to exercise greater flexibility in the provision of services, but would also serve the federal government's goal of co-operative restraint upon the rising cost of health and social security programs.
Of equal importance to the social well-being of Canadians is an adequate supply of affordable housing in a satisfactory community environment. Therefore, the goal of one million new homes over four years remains a key element of the Government's housing policy. In concert with other levels of government and the private sector the Government will work to increase the efficiency and impact of Canada's total housing effort.
The Government attaches continuing importance to meeting the aspirations of Canada's native peoples and, in particular, to the just settlement of their land claims. At this session, you will be asked to approve the negotiated settlement of claims in the James Bay region.
In the aftermath of the highly successful Montreal Olympics, and the gratifying results achieved by Canadian athletes, federal support for selected amateur sport and fitness programs will be further augmented.

This year, the Law Reform Commission of Canada submitted a report on family law which merits the attention of all Canadians. The Government intends to carry on discussions with the provinces to encourage the creation of unified Family Courts with comprehensive jurisdiction over family law permitting disputes to be dealt with more constructively. In addition the government will discuss with the provinces and with the public other aspects of family law bearing on the stability of marriage, the protection of children and the fair sharing of the economic consequences of marital breakdown.
Canadians are becoming increasingly sensitive to the fact that Canada cannot live in dignity as a nation while other people, in less fortunate lands, live in a state of deprivation and hopelessness.
It is not in Canada's economic, political or moral interest to allow the gap to widen between the wealth of the few and the poverty of the many. Therefore the Government will continue to participate in the task of shaping a new international economic order, designed to provide a greater measure of hope to nations seeking the opportunity to help themselves.
The world is now confronted with a broad range of problems of such complexity and widespread scope that no single nation or group of nations is able to apply effective solutions. Only global solutions will do.
Increasingly, therefore, Canada's international activities are being directed toward broad-scale co-operative activities. Human settlements, the law of the sea, environmental protection, food and resources production, terrorism, population growth, control of nuclear armaments, economic development-all demand shared responsibility and universal involvement.

III-Individual Freedom
In speaking about the Government's plans to promote greater unity of spirit and equality of opportunity both in the world community and here at home, it becomes obvious that the achievement of both those goals demands a healthy respect for individual rights, particularly the right of free men and women to exert a real influence over decisions affecting their own future.
At a time of growing complexity in public affairs it is especially important to enhance the citizen's right of access to the information necessary to make well-informed judgements and take responsible action.
The Government therefore places great value on the continuing work of the joint parliamentary committee which has been studying the question of freedom of information, and plans to submit a policy paper to that committee in the hope that early agreement might be reached on the best methods to improve public access to government information. In the meantime, the Government will increase the number and range of internal documents available to the public.
To the same end, you will be asked to consider a Bill designed to clarify the duties and responsibilities of the Auditor General of Canada, and to provide him with better means of fulfilling his important function as a servant of Parliament.
In a similar effort to remove obstacles to information and to equal opportunity, the Government will introduce a Human Rights Bill. The major effect of the Bill will be to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, marital status, or physical handicap. In particular, the Bill will establish the principle of equal compensation for work of equal value performed by persons of either sex. It will establish a citizen s statutory right to gain greater access to personal records in federal information banks and to correct that information when it is in error. It will also limit the gathering of personal information by the Government.

The Government and all Parliamentarians are concerned about the extent to which the average citizen is informed about Parliament. The Government wishes to provide access to the Parliamentary process for as many Canadians as possible. It will therefore seek approval to enable the proceedings of the House of Commons to be broadcast.
IV-Role of Government
It is essential to the enhancement of unity, equality of opportunity and individual freedom that Canadians work together in a spirit of co-operation and mutual respect. To that end, it is important for all participants to have a well defined view of their respective roles in the pursuit of national objectives.
It is appropriate, therefore, to define the role of government in economic and social planning and action. There are some who acknowledge only a very limited role for government, believing that the market system allocates resources most efficiently for production and growth, is least wasteful, and most conducive to individual liberty and initiative.
That view is vigorously opposed by those who insist on a continually expanding role for government in directing economic growth, correcting the inadequacies of the market system, and assuring a socially acceptable distribution of incomes. This view asserts that government spending and intervention must increase to compensate for the failure of the market to serve social goals.
The Government favours a middle road between those two extremes.
This middle road represents a commitment to a society in which all Canadians can develop their full potential, a society in which justice, compassion, tolerance and understanding lead to a strong and united Canada, a society based upon individual initiative and marked by personal freedom. The choice of the middle road implies a reliance on the market to stimulate the growth Canada needs, together with an enduring commitment to social justice and equality of opportunity. On the other hand, that choice also implies that the working of the market must be improved and that less costly, less interventionist ways must be found to pursue social goals.
These choices have shaped the Government's legislative program for the coming months, just as it will shape appropriate policies for the post-control period.
Obviously, the development of the new strategies required by the times in which we live will demand the closest possible co-operation among governments, workers, businessmen, cooperative and voluntary organizations and all other sectors of society. To that end, the Government will launch a major series of consultations throughout Canada to secure a greater sharing of economic and social responsibility among all Canadians.
Consultation in this context does not mean simply informing the public about Government decisions. Nor does it mean an aimless search for the opinions of others. It means that the Government will place before interested Canadians its assessment of the major problems we must solve together, and its definition of the available options.
Parliament will have a vital role to play, as of course will the provincial governments and their municipalities. For example, the provinces will be asked to enter into early consultations with the federal government on the renewal of agreements relating to the anti-inflation program, and on the process by which, at the appropriate time, controls may be removed.
The Government is confident that Canada will realize the great potential of the next decade, because Canadians in all sectors of our society are opening their minds to the future, and are demonstrating a willingness to adopt the means necessary to translate opportunity into reality. Canada will make steady progress toward the goals of national unity, equality of opportunity, and the enhancement of individual freedom, because the people of this country have the courage to

tackle difficult problems, the will to take our own future into our own hands, and the wisdom to understand that we work effectively only when we work together.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.

The Government intends to present a budget in this Session.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
