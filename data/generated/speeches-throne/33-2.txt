Ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
It is with pleasure that I welcome you to the Second Session of the thirty-third Parliament of Canada and express to you, on behalf of all our fellow-Canadians, my appreciation and gratitude for the work which you do here. It is you, above all others, who make our Parliamentary system work, and you who are responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of an institution which is essential to the welfare of Canadians and the unimpeded enjoyment of our freedoms.
Expo '86 has been a focus of international attention that has brought pride and joy to millions of Canadians. The success of British Columbia's world exposition strikingly demonstrates the creative skills of our people.
I have had the honour of presenting my respects, and yours, to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth on the occasion of her sixtieth birthday. At this time I conveyed to her Canada's feelings of loyalty. The warm affection accorded their Royal
Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of Wales-so evident during their visit to Expo '86-again reminds us of the vitality of the monarchy and its enduring contribution to Canadian life. I have also had the opportunity to be present at the marriage of Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of York, and to receive here the visit of Her Majesty the Queen Mother, who once again charmed us with her intelligence and her amazing vitality. You may rest assured that I have, on these memorable occasions, given renewed expression to the respect which we all feel.
Two years ago, my government received a national mandate-a mandate for reform. It was a mandate that summoned Canada to the tasks of national reconciliation, economic renewal, social justice, and to a constructive internationalism. Today, my Ministers believe these goals are within reach.
We live today in a world of increasing uncertainty and interdependence. We live in a world where unforeseen events, both at home and abroad, demand flexibility and adaptiveness.
Although my government will remain sensitive to changing circumstances, it is determined to pursue these national objectives in the confidence that their fulfillment will bring lasting benefit to all Canadians.
Canadian agriculture is a vital part of our national economy. Aware of the present difficulties, my government will work in close consultation with provincial governments and farm organizations to help alleviate personal hardship in our farm communities.
The Government has already taken special steps to lower farm input costs, improve stabilization programs, and help farmers in financial difficulty.
In the past, regrettably, agriculture has not been a priority in international trade negotiations. My government placed this issue on the agenda of the Economic Summit in Tokyo, and helped secure unanimous agreement to address subsidies in the new round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations.
In meeting its commitment to Canadian agriculture, my government will spare no effort in seeking to protect the interests of Canada's farming community in the face of unfair pricing and subsidy practices conducted beyond our borders.
My government has acted to enhance the effective operation of Canada s energy industry, by negotiating the Western, the Atlantic, and the Nova Scotia accords and by taking other strong measures to support activity in a period of depressed world prices. Close cooperation with the producing provinces and the energy industry is a foremost objective of my Ministers as efforts continue to sustain Canada's energy prospects through this difficult period. These efforts are consistent with the true meaning and spirit of national unity.
Despite current difficulties, encouraging progress has been made towards renewing and strengthening the national economy. Unemployment is at its lowest level in over four years. Average incomes of Canadian families rose in real terms in 1985 for the first time in five years. The federal deficit has declined for the first time in six years. The prime rate is the lowest it has been in eight years. And government program spending has significantly declined for the first time in forty years. These economic indicators are encouraging.
Our efforts are meeting with encouraging success. The challenge now is to forge ahead. My government will do so by remaining true to the course set in the past two years. My government will continue its policy of prudent fiscal and financial management and will seek practical ways to encourage self-reliance and provide individual Canadians the incentive and opportunity to achieve greater security and well-being for themselves and for their families.
National Reconciliation
My government's commitment to national reconciliation invites all Canadians to participate fully and actively in the development of their country.
The Canadian Charter of Rights and the Constitution remain incomplete without the assent of Quebec. My Ministers have begun consultations with the provinces on this important subject. Should there appear reasonable prospects for agreement, formal negotiations will proceed in the expectation that Quebec will take its rightful place as a full partner in the Canadian Constitution.
The question of aboriginal rights is still on the constitutional agenda as a result of the Accord signed with the provinces in 1983. Pursuant to that agreement, a First Ministers Conference on aboriginal constitutional affairs will be convened. This will be the third and last such conference provided for in the 1983 Accord. In cooperation with the provinces, my government will exert every possible effort to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion.
Official bilingualism is an indispensable feature of our national character. Seventeen years after its enactment, Canada's Official Languages Act now needs to be revised. Appropriate legislation will be introduced in this Session to ensure, as well, that this Act conforms with the Canadian Charter of Rights.
My Ministers will propose amendments concerning the objectives and powers of the National Capital Commission. It is their intent to give greater expression and meaning to our national symbols.
Canada's National Parks represent a heritage of great importance to the present and future generations. My government will ask Parliament to approve major reforms to the National Parks Act for the first time since the original Act was passed, over five decades ago.
The preservation of historic properties is important to fostering a sense of history and national identity among Canadians. The government of Canada, as the largest owner of heritage sites and properties in the country, will assume a leadership role in their restoration and preservation.
Economic Renewal
Canada's program of economic renewal has as its goal the building of a national economy equipped to compete in an environment of intense global competition, changing markets, and new technologies. Economic renewal will be furthered by continued progress in restoring health to our public finances, by trade initiatives and by tax reform.
My government has committed itself to four principles in its quest to restore fiscal health to Canada. First, to reduce the growth in the national debt to less than the growth in the economy by the end of this decade. Second, to achieve continuing, sizeable, year-over-year reductions in the deficit. Third, to ensure substantial annual declines in the government's financial requirements. And fourth, to ensure that the greater part of this progress is secured through effective expenditure restraint.
Success in this quest will foster a climate of investor and consumer confidence that will continue to support lower inflation, lower interest rates, higher growth and more job opportunities for Canadians.
If Canada is to achieve an enduring economic recovery, government must also ensure that our country's interests are secured and enhanced in the international sphere.
Nearly one third of our economy depends on international markets. Our future is trade. That is why my government is seeking to open and secure new markets for Canada everywhere in the world. These efforts include bilateral talks with the United States and multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the GATT.
My government intends to improve Canada's status as a trading nation among our major partners. Particular emphasis will be placed upon trade with Japan and other Pacific Rim countries.
Trade promotion, however vigorous, cannot succeed if world markets important to Canadian exporters are threatened by increased protectionism.
Such pressures emphasize the importance of my government's pursuit of a mutually advantageous trade agreement with the United States. These talks are being accompanied by extensive consultations with the provinces, business and labour. Successful negotiations will strengthen both our economy and our capacity to reinforce our culture, our sovereignty, our commitment to regional development and the fundamental purposes of Canadian social policy.
Progress has already been made towards my government's objective of comprehensive tax reform. We have begun to restructure the corporate tax system. Equity in the personal income field has been enhanced through the introduction of the minimum tax. A refundable Sales Tax Credit has been introduced. Opportunities for tax avoidance have been curtailed.
In my government's further consideration of tax reform, fairness will be a guiding principle. The objectives of reform will be to lower tax rates and to
reduce reliance upon personal income tax by improving the revenue balance between personal income and other taxes. A simpler and more comprehensible tax system would also be welcomed by all Canadians.
During this session, you will be asked to consider new initiatives to strengthen the competitiveness of the private sector.
To help remove obstacles to economic growth, my Ministers will continue to reduce the burden of paperwork and regulation, to advance the process of privatization of Crown Corporations, and to press for the removal of barriers to interprovincial trade.
My Ministers will introduce programs to promote small business and entrepreneurial values. Included will be measures to improve procurement procedures, to strengthen the unsolicited proposals program for small companies and entrepreneurs, to increase technology transfer from government laboratories, and to develop new initiatives to promote entrepreneurship among youth.
My government will again be placing before Parliament measures to give Canadians a more efficient, competitive and safe transport system by relieving the burden of unnecessary regulations on the transportation sector.
My government will propose a new regulatory framework for the financial services industry that will promote competition, efficiency, and international competitiveness, while strengthening consumer protection.
For many years, successive governments have sought to provide measures intended to promote regional development. Their efforts have not been as effective as hoped. Regional disparity remains an unacceptable reality of Canadian life. Our experience has shown that spending more money, by itself, has not solved the problem.
It is time to consider new approaches, to examine how our considerable and growing support for Canada's regions can be used more efficiently, more effectively and with greater sensitivity to local conditions and opportunities. In renewing their efforts to come to grips with this longstanding problem, my Ministers are convinced many positive proposals for new policy initiatives will come from those who live and work in the regions concerned.
Building on the human and natural resource strengths of the regions, a renewed cooperative effort will lead to a new development agenda. Special emphasis will be given to diversifying the economic base of Western Canada.
As a first step in achieving improved results from this sustained national approach, an Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency will be constituted to facilitate and coordinate all federal development initiatives in the area. This agency will make fuller use of the expertise available in the Atlantic region and invite the maximum participation of other governments and organizations in the area.
My government is concerned about the increasing concentration of corporations, particularly where takeovers serve to increase corporate size without creating new jobs or stimulating economic growth in Canada. Some aspects of this essentially non-productive activity will be examined and considered by Members of this House.
The importance of the fishing industry to Canada is fundamental. To provide increased safety for our fishermen and to protect their material investments, my government will place special emphasis on improving the management of small craft harbours in all fishing areas.
The forest sector is Canada's largest net export earner. My Ministers have substantially increased funding for forestry renewal. The government will continue to work in close partnership with the provinces, industry, and private woodlot owners to ensure that Canada's rich forest heritage continues as a vital source of wealth and jobs for future generations.
Measures will be introduced to strengthen Canada's cooperatives and to give recognition to their role in community development.
My government is deeply committed to supporting, with the provinces, a system of post-secondary education based on excellence and equality of opportunity. To help meet the challenges facing higher education, my government will propose a national forum on post-secondary education, to be held early next year.
My Ministers have begun to forge a partnership with the provinces, with the scientific and educational communities, and with business and labour in an effort to stimulate increased technological development in Canada. To assist and encourage cooperation between the universities and private sector in research and development, my government has announced an initiative that could provide a billion dollars in new funding for scientific research over the next five years.
My government will build upon this partnership by introducing a new four-point program to ensure that support for science, technology and education is more clearly focused in the national interest.
First, my government will appoint a National Advisory Board for Industrial Technology, chaired by the Prime Minister and composed of some of Canada's leading industrialists and scientists. This committee will assess national science and technology goals and policies, and their application to Canada's economy. Second, in full cooperation with the provinces, my government will seek to achieve high standards of excellence in education, technology development, and innovation. Third, it will introduce a new Federal Science and Technology Strategy, building on the initiatives undertaken to date. The strategy will introduce the necessary reforms within the federal administration to encourage Canada's international competitiveness. Fourth, my government will convene a National Conference on Technology and Innovation to assist Canada to define new technology goals.
My government's commitment to high technology as a motive force in Canada's economic growth will be expressed in legislation to establish a Canadian space agency. International cooperation in the peaceful use of space is essential to the development of key technologies. Working in cooperation with industry, universities and provinces, the new agency will help to ensure that the benefits of Canada's role in space will be shared by all Canadians.
Constructive Internationalism
The people of Canada maintain a deep interest in their country's role in the world. As Honourable Members of the Special Joint Committee of this Parliament know, Canadians seek a confident, constructive, active internationalism that reflects our hopes for the world as well as our own vital national interests.
From my own travels, and those of my Ministers, I can attest that other countries, large and small, look to Canada to play a vital role in the international community. Over the past year, I have travelled to Italy and the Vatican, while the Prime Minister has represented my government at the Commonwealth Conference, at the 40th Anniversary of the United Nations, the Francophone Summit, the Tokyo Summit, and in visits to France, Japan, China, South Korea, and the United States.
Our support for the multilateral institutions and agencies of which we are members remains the cornerstone of our foreign policy.
With Her Majesty the Queen as its head and unifying presence, the Commonwealth brings together countries of the North and South in support of common ideals and aspirations. The Commonwealth is central to Canada's efforts to promote, through concerted international action, a process of political dialogue in South Africa aimed at establishing representative government. My government will continue this effort, through the Commonwealth and the United Nations, until apartheid is abolished.
The world is aware how spontaneously the Canadian people rallied to the challenge of African famine and relief, demonstrating a concern and compassion so much a part of the national character. As Canadians, we will be called upon to respond to other challenges in the Third World. In reaffirming our commitments, it will be our purpose to find new partners in the ongoing efforts to pursue opportunities for increased development.
No task is more important to Canadians than preserving world peace and security. My government is encouraged by the prospects for renewed dialogue between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union. We share the hope of other nations of the world that progress towards these talks will be sustained and appreciable.
Arms control and disarmament are essential elements of Canadian policy. We are in the forefront of multilateral discussions concerning conventional arms control and confidence-building in Europe. In the nuclear field, both the verification of existing agreements and the conclusion of new accords are vital elements in Canada's efforts. As a further step towards these objectives, my government will host this month an international symposium that will explore means of improving verification techniques.
My government recognizes that security is the surest safeguard of liberty. Accordingly, my government has taken steps to modernize and renew the
Speech from the Throne
strength of our Armed Forces and increase our NATO contingent in Western Europe.
The Government asserts complete sovereignty over the Canadian Arctic and recognizes that sovereignty requires a vigorous national presence. My government has drawn straight baselines around the perimeter of the Arctic archipelago to preserve Canadian sovereignty over the land, sea, and ice of the Canadian Arctic. Canada will construct one of the most powerful icebreakers in the world to enhance our sovereign rights and to contribute to the development of the North.
Other measures have been taken or will be initiated to support this vital national purpose, including more research on polar conditions, defence training exercises in the Arctic, and the establishment of a National Park at Ellesmere Island.
Social Justice
A dynamic and changing society poses new challenges for social policy. Existing programs are not always wholly successful in meeting their objectives. They must be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate to today's circumstances and they must be strengthened where necessary. At the same time, new circumstances require the development of new programs.
My Ministers are well aware that social policy concerns are more satisfactorily met in a strong and growing economy that, in turn, requires steady progress in restoring fiscal health to our nation's finances. But fiscal responsibility is fully compatible with social responsibility.
My government will continue to enlist the support of all in pursuit of the common goal: a modern, tolerant, and caring nation in which its citizens are secure and prosperous.
Canadians would want their governments to give the highest priority in social policy to those who are in greatest need. As well, Canadians expect to enjoy the highest quality in health care and other social benefits that have become fundamental to our national quality of life.
My government is resolved to defend and strengthen the institution of the Canadian family.
Only now is our society beginning its effort to adjust to the evolving changes in family relationships and responsibilities, particularly concerning working parents. My government recognizes that adequate, quality child care must become available. Following the report of your committee, my government will initiate discussions with the provinces, business and labour with a view to implementing a concerted approach to child care.
As a national priority, we must continue to remove the barriers that have prevented women from participating freely and equitably in the mainstream of Canadian society. My government regards the recent significant increase in appointments of women to the highest levels of the public service and to federal boards and commissions as only a first step towards full equality. My Ministers hope and expect the private sector will regard this progress as an example to follow. In its desire to further the advancement of women in government, my Ministers will continue their efforts to correct inequitable wage rates in the public service.
My government will take effective action against child sexual abuse, violent forms of pornography involving women and children, child prostitution, and the grave and growing threat posed by the traffic in illegal drugs.
A national drug strategy and a comprehensive program dealing with impaired drivers will be brought forward to support the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse. My government will continue to provide domestic and international leadership in controlling drug abuse in amateur sport.
Reforms to the Criminal Code will be continued during this session of Parliament, reflecting the importance Canadians attach to such values as respect for the law and the protection of innocent citizens.
Measures will also be put before you designed to protect and assist victims of criminal violence. Further action will be proposed to assist in finding missing children.
Canadians are becoming increasingly aware of the suffering of battered women. This intolerable affront to human dignity and personal security compels my government's commitment to work with the provinces to implement on an urgent basis the most effective means and methods of action.
After a decade of debate, an historic agreement with the provinces has been reached that will improve benefits under the Canada Pension Plan, beginning on January 1, 1987. It will also put the plan on a sound financial footing for the future.
The federal Pension Benefits Standards Act, which sets standards that employer-sponsored pension plans must meet, has also been completely revised. The changes introduced will be of fundamental significance for wage earners, especially women in the labour force, and for the spouses of pension plan members.
The introduction of the new Canadian Jobs Strategy, which for the first time sets targets for women's participation, has helped women, particularly immigrant women, and the unemployed in their search for lasting and productive employment.
My government is encouraged by the decline in youth unemployment. However, much remains to be done. My Ministers are committed to federal-provincial and private sector cooperative action that will enhance job opportunities and encourage greater participation and involvement of young Canadians in productive and challenging initiatives.
Canadians recognize the courage and talent of our disabled citizens. Inspired by the example of Rick Hansen, we are made more aware of the potential for new directions and initiatives to aid the disabled.
My government will work with the provinces, the private sector and voluntary organizations to develop measures to ensure that Canadians have access to the literacy skills that are the prerequisites for participation in an advanced economy.
Ongoing improvements have also been made in assuring greater income security for the elderly. All widows and widowers aged 60 to 64 are now eligible to receive Spouses' Allowance Benefits. A new program of Older Worker Adjustment is also being negotiated with the provinces. The Government will introduce legislation to increase tax assistance for retirement savings through Registered Retirement Savings Plans. The object will be to make access to tax assistance fairer between employees and the self-employed, and to increase the flexibility of options for the use of Registered Retirement Savings Plan savings by senior citizens.
In a spirit of deep respect and appreciation, my government will continue to address the needs of Canada's veterans. The Veterans Independence Program will be broadened to allow a greater number of First World War veterans to qualify immediately for the benefits designed to enable them to remain independent in their own homes rather than be compelled to accept institutional care. New legislation will also be introduced to streamline the pension process to provide faster, more efficient service to veterans.
In acknowledging the tens of thousands of Canadians who serve their communities and country as volunteers, my Ministers will propose further support to encourage the growth of voluntarism in our society.
Canada's amateur athletes instill pride in our country and achieve excellence in international competition. My government renews its commitment to the increased participation of young Canadian men and women in a wide variety of athletic endeavours, including the 1988 Winter Olympics that Canada will host in Calgary.
It is imperative that Canada's multicultural and multiracial reality be integral to all facets of our national life to reflect the vital and distinctive nature of Canadian society.
To that end, my government will: encourage the entrepreneurial spirit that characterizes our many minority communities and that contributes so essentially to Canada's economic development; extend recognition to minority community organizations in our society and increase equitable participation in appointments to federal boards and agencies; and affirm that any existing remnants of institutional barriers that limit opportunities for visible minorities or other groups or individuals are dismantled.
My government will continue to assert a positive leadership role in opposing racism and discrimination, in whatever form. It will continue to resist injustices imposed upon any ethnic, religious, or racial group in the knowledge that to do otherwise would diminish this nation's profound commitment to universal tolerance and human dignity.
Honourable Members: you will be asked to consider amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act, which will represent further progress in the long march of this nation towards full equality.
My government will propose comprehensive legislation designed to simplify and improve Canada's refugee determination process. These reforms will produce a system which is both fair and effective. It will assist genuine refugees in need of protection and discourage abuse of Canada's humanitarian tradition.
My government recognizes fully the essential relationship between a healthy environment and the quality of Canadian life. A new Environmental Protection Act will be introduced to improve my government's capacity, in concert with the provinces, to deal effectively with pollution, focusing on toxic chemicals. You will also be asked to consider measures to improve water quality in Canada and to safeguard citizens from the hazards of chemicals in our society.
My government remains determined to pursue with the United States the rapid implementation of the recommendations of our Special Envoys with respect to acid rain.
Following the recommendations of an industry-labour-government task force, my government will propose legislation to establish a Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System.
My government has begun to renew our economy and society for the benefit of all Canadians. It has acted to strengthen our national sovereignty and to affirm our independence. But there remains much more to be done.
Each generation of Canadians has risen to the challenges of nation-building. Today's generation confronts its own challenges: we must act now to ensure that the ties which bind us together as Canadians remain strong, in our national cultural institutions, in our sense of community and in our pride as a nation.
Whether through railways in the last century, or broadcasting in this century, Canadians have responded to the task of building one nation across a massive continent. Throughout our history, Canadians have acquired credentials as peacekeepers, as entrepreneurs, as innovators.
Today the new challenge is to assert our interests in a world that is intimate, competitive, and driven by rapid technological change.
Your challenge, in this Parliament, is to apply those Canadian qualities with the same vision and the same commitment that created a nation from a wilderness. The new challenge is to open up new horizons for Canadians-those to be reached through knowledge and information.
In this new environment, we must ensure that all Canadians can pursue their own dreams and expand their own opportunities through greater use of information and knowledge about one another and the world beyond.
To begin debate on this fundamental challenge, my government will define its objectives and ways to achieve them.
It will be essential to ensure that the ideas and information which flow through a modern national communications system reflect the distinct cultural values of the Canadian people. For this reason, the government will act to strengthen the Canadian broadcasting system and renew our commitment to Canadian cultural values.
To a considerable degree, our sense of national purpose, our national identity, and our economic prosperity will depend on our capacity to respond to the opportunities which flow from this new information age.
Our dual linguistic heritage and unique history situate Canada within two great communities of nations, the Commonwealth and la Francophonie. Canada is thus positioned to reaffirm its role in the world by developing joint projects with member countries of these two vast families of nations, to share with them Canadian communications and information technologies while bringing to Canadians a greater diversity of ideas and cultural expressions.
By so doing, Canada will renew in innovative ways its commitment to an established institution, the Commonwealth, and contribute actively to the emergence of a new one, la Francophonie.
The great tasks to which you are committed in this Parliament are national in character. The important reforms you will have considered and adopted give to each the opportunity to make a valued, individual contribution to the legislative process.
Your deliberations must address the aspirations of all Canadians and reflect their pride and confidence in the enduring strengths of the political institutions
they believe to be the guarantors of freedom and security, and the guardians of the nation's future.
My government shares the expectations of all Canadians that public office holders maintain the highest standards of conduct, especially in the area of conflict of interest. It will be considering proposals which reflect the essential considerations of fairness to the office holder and the protection of the public's interest.
Members of the House of Commons:
I think with pleasure of the determination you will display as you embark on the program of work prepared by my government, and of the good use you will make of your skill and experience. I shall follow your debates with interest. I am assured that this new session will mark a further stage in the growth and flowering of our life as a nation.
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to consider legislation to advance the economic, social and international interests of Canadians.
In pursuit of these worthy objectives, may Divine Providence guide your efforts.
