Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have greatly looked forward to being with you here in the Canadian Parliament in my Silver Jubilee year. Whenever I am in this wonderful country
of Canada, with her vast resources and unlimited challenges, 1 feel thankful that Canadians have been so successful in establishing a vigorous democracy well suited to a proud and free people.
In this historic Chamber surrounded by the symbols and records of generations of Canadian legislators, I am very conscious of what Parliament has
achieved-by transforming the visions and ideals of a great country into the enduring law of the land.
In ten visits together to Canada spread over a quarter of a century-seven in the last decade alone-Prince Philip and I have met many thousands of Canadians in all walks of life, of all ages, in every province and territory. My happiest memories of our travels throughout Canada have been these individual contacts which have revealed the enormous strength and astonishing diversity of this nation.
A generation of Canadians has been born, and grown to maturity during my reign. 1 know you will understand when 1 say that I have a special interest in these young men and women, contemporaries of our own children. They are people made strong by the achievements of their parents and grandparents, but not imprisoned by the prejudices of the past. In their sensitivity towards other people, in their sense of justice, their generosity and good will, lie not only lessons for us all, but also the best and surest hope for unity and understanding among Canadians everywhere. I look forward in meeting more of them next year in Edmonton when I shall have the pleasure of opening the Commonwealth Games.
I have always been full of admiration for what Canada is: the new generation fill me with confidence for what Canada can become.
The growth of those young men and women over the past quarter-century has been matched by a rapid expansion of Canada's economic strength and international stature.
Within an evolving Commonwealth, Canada's influence is steadily growing, particularly as an advocate of human dignity, justice and co-operation.
This greater influence has been used by Canada to pursue such critical goals as a more equitable sharing of wealth and opportunity, the enhancement of individual freedom, the conservation of the planet's scarce resources, and the prudent control of nuclear technology.
The post-war period of sustained economic growth conferred great new wealth upon Canada. Productivity and standards of living improved substantially, and the country could afford to provide better economic protection for the sick, the aged, the unemployed and the poor.
But growth produced new sets of problems with which the world community has not yet learned to cope successfully.
High rates of unemployment and inflation are clear signals of the inadequacy of economic strategies appropriate to simpler times. They are also signals of the urgent need for important structural adjustments in the economies of Canada and other industrialized countries. More than that, they are the symptoms of an illness which can be cured only by a readjustment of our values, and by a re-discovery of the merits of self-discipline and fair sharing.
The process of change will require continued consultation with Canadians, so that there may be a shared appreciation of current problems, and a shared acceptance of strategies for the future.
The government publications entitled The Way Ahead and The Agenda For Co-operation were designed to involve all Canadians in the discussion of how best to adapt to changing economic circumstances.
The changes that are now taking place impose burdens on some Canadians, and the Government remains committed to protecting these individuals.
The Government has recently made new funding proposals to the provinces which will improve the efficiency and flexibility of social services such as the rehabilitation of disabled persons, day care and community development services. The delivery of these services will thereby better reflect varying conditions and priorities across the country. It is hoped that the response of provincial governments will lead to the introduction of a revised Social Services Act during this Session.
The human hardship imposed by the current level of unemployment in Canada is deeply disturbing. It is neither just nor tolerable that in this country there should be so many men and women deprived of the dignity of self-supporting work, unable to meet their financial commitments and plan confidently for the future. It is intolerable that so many are deprived of their right to secure and productive lives, and that their families bear an unfair burden of worry, uncertainty, and deprivation. On a national scale, unemployment now constitutes a very serious obstacle to economic growth.
The benefits of existing government job stimulation programs, such as youth and community employment projects, and direct job creation by government, are visible to all. New initiatives have also been taken to encourage the mobility and upgrade the skills of the Canadian labour force, and to encourage small business. But more must be done.
To stimulate the expansion of industrial activity and create jobs in the private sector, the Government adopted a number of initiatives in its March budget. The investment tax credit was extended and was also increased in slower-growing regions of the country as a means of reinforcing the regional development policy of the Government. Tax incentives were increased for energy exploration and rail facilities. The dividend tax credit was substantially increased to encourage investment; deductible capital losses were doubled; and businesses were permitted to adjust inventory valuations to partially offset the effects of inflation.
Legislation will be reintroduced to effect these tax reductions and investment incentives. But the current unemployment situation obviously requires further action. Therefore, this legislation will be significantly strengthened to provide further immediate stimulus to the economy and to create new employment. The details of these further initiatives will be announced by the Minister of Finance during the course of the debate which begins tomorrow.
Further stimulus must not be allowed to compromise our objective of continuing reductions in inflation. The Government will continue to exercise responsibility in controlling its expenditures. The continuation of the income and price controls program through the early part of 1978 will help to contain inflationary pressures, but controls on prices and incomes must then end. You will be asked to approve legislation to amend the Anti-Inflation Act to allow an orderly process of decontrol, as well as legislation to create a monitoring agency.
The Government is confident that the outcome of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations now underway in Geneva will be of considerable benefit to Canada. Consultations with the provinces and with the private sector will be intensified, in order to ensure that this benefit is shared by all regions of the country.
In preparation for the new trading environment which Canada will face in the 1980's, the Government will introduce measures in this Session to enhance Canada's exports. Further support will be provided to the private sector in undertaking large capital projects in other countries.
In the continuing implementation of its food strategy, the Government will work with the provinces to ensure a co-ordinated approach to agricultural development, making better use of Canada's food-producing potential.
As part of the Government's consultation process, a National Food Conference will be held. It will bring together representatives of governments, producers, consumers and the food industry to work together toward a national agreement on how Canada's food strategy should be further developed and implemented. New initiatives are underway to provide the consumer with readily [Mr. Speaker.!
accessible information on food prices and nutrition. The Government will ensure that the views of producers, processors and consumers are adequately represented on marketing boards and agencies, so that they may operate more effectively.
Several measures will be placed before you to improve the national transportation system. For example, new ports legislation will be introduced which will enhance local autonomy while maintaining the overall national interest.
In the field of energy, it will continue to be the determined policy of the Government to work with the provinces toward the goal of self-reliance, particularly by encouraging exploration and conservation to reduce our dependence on imported oil. Further encouragement will be given to the development of energy saving technology, of renewable energy sources, and of the application of solar energy.
There are encouraging signs that the policy measures introduced over the past few years to promote exploration and development are beginnning to bear fruit. In particular, exploration for natural gas in Western Canada appears to have been highly successful over the past two years. There are also encouraging prospects in the Beaufort Sea area and the Arctic Islands. Petro-Canada, in co-operation with the private sector, is seriously examining the feasibility of delivering natural gas to markets in Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces.
Exploration in the Arctic will be further encouraged by the proposed northern gas pipeline. A Bill will be placed before you to seek your approval for the implementation of the pipeline agreement negotiated with the Government of the United States. This historic agreement-which will launch one of the largest civil engineering projects in the history of the world-will provide immense benefits to Canada through jobs, investment, the purchase of materials and through easier and cheaper access to northern Canadian gas reserves.
You will also be asked to approve a Canadian Petroleum and Natural Gas Act, which will regulate oil and gas exploration on federally administered lands and establish a system of royalty payments.
The Government is committed to ensure that northern development occurs in a manner consistent with the rights of northern native peoples to negotiate a just and reasonable settlement of their land claims, and to participate in and shape such development. Consultations with native groups are continuing. In the Yukon, the Government will propose special measures to ensure that pipeline construction will not prejudice native rights or foreclose opportunities. In the Northwest Territories, the Government has appointed a commissioner to consult with interested groups and advise on the pace and manner of the further constitutional evolution of the Territories.
So pervasive are economic influences on people's daily lives that failure to secure economic stability and justice would, in itself, stimulate a sense of alienation, mutual hostility, and divisiveness among Canadians. In the context of the current national unity debate, therefore, it is imperative that feelings of linguistic or cultural inequality not be allowed to be further poisoned by evidence of economic injustice. Conversely, there is no doubt that the level of uncertainty evident in Quebec has a negative effect on the economy.
Few countries are as blessed as Canada, where a wealth of freedom and of this world's goods is apparent for all to see. Perhaps only those who have come here from less fortunate lands can appreciate to the full the great good fortune of living in a country so favored by nature, and so enriched by its cultural diversity.
Even in the midst of plenty, however, there are Canadians who know they are not receiving their fair share. To cite just one example, in those parts of the Atlantic Provinces where unemployment is particularly severe, some see themselves as an excluded group, able to gaze upon the good life only from a distance. There are many living in the West who have contributed much to Canada, yet believe their voice is little heard by others. There are many living in Quebec who feel deeply that Canada at present does not provide them with the opportunity to
fulfill their reasonable aspirations. There are native peoples across the land who are still in search of a better life for themselves and their children.
This discontent in such a wealthy country must find its causes in the human spirit, and it is there also that the unity of the nation must be found. A greater willingness to listen to each other, to understand each other's needs, a greater generosity between individuals and between different parts of the country, a greater willingness to sacrifice so that others may have a chance, to take less so that others may have enough-all these are in the realm of the spirit. All are essential to the unity of the country. Governments, of course, have a special responsibility to both encourage and respond to the spirit of unity by their words and their actions. Canadians are, I believe, coming to recognize the seriousness of the problem. They are recognizing the need to make a new and deeper dedication to mutual understanding and sharing.
The Government dedicates itself profoundly to the re-discovery of the spirit of unity. It wishes to learn from all who are interested in Canada and who have thoughts on how it can be made a better place in which to live. It is prepared, particularly, to work with the governments of the provinces, all of whom have a vital interest in a better Canada.
The Government recently appointed the Task Force on Canadian Unity which is now in the process of canvassing opinion in all parts of Canada. The work of the Task Force should assist Canadians to participate more actively in debate, and to make a greater contribution to the future shaping of the country.
The Government will also be placing before Parliament, and in this way before the people of Canada, later in this Session, a measure that will contain a number of proposals relating to the Constitution of Canada, which it believes will be of particular importance for the future of the country. The proposals will be concerned, among other matters, with the essential nature of the Canadian federation and its objectives, with certain fundamental rights and freedoms which the Government feels should be enjoyed by all Canadians as being essential to Canada's continuing existence as a free and democratic society, and with certain elements of the framework of the Canadian federation that are important to its effective functioning.
It is the hope of the Government that these proposals will stimulate a process of constitutional review in which all governments in Canada will share and in which Canadians generally will have an opportunity to express their views and convictions about the kind of Canada they wish to have now and in the future. We may confidently expect that, from that process, may emerge a new federalism that will receive the support and the devotion of Canadians everywhere.
The question of language rights is of particular relevance to national unity, and the Government has therefore welcomed the historic "Statement on Language" approved at the meeting of provincial Premiers at St. Andrews in August. The Government believes that this important initiative can and should become a basic part of our Constitution and has recently asked the provinces to consider this possibility.
After consultation with the provinces, the Government will amend the criminal code to guarantee the right of accused persons to be tried in the official language of their choice.
The goal of enhancing the rights and freedoms of Canadians can also be pursued through commitment to the principle of open government. An example of that commitment was the enactment of the Human Rights Act, and the recent appointment of the Human Rights Commission and the Privacy Commissioner. To the same end, the Government looks forward to hearing the views of Parliament on the Government's proposals concerning public access to official documents. In the further promotion of open government, you will be asked to approve the establishment of the office of ombudsman to deal with complaints arising from federal administrative actions.
The Government will also propose the amendment of the Official Languages Act, in order to make more specific its provisions respecting the language of work of federal employees, to strengthen the role of the Commissioner of Official Languages, and to clarify the role of the courts in safeguarding the equality of status of the official languages within the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada.
A comprehensive policy for official language minorities will be announced, and initiatives will be taken to ensure its full implementation within federal institutions. In the coming months, the Government will be proposing specific initiatives to be taken in collaboration with the provinces, and exploring ways of assisting the provinces in measures which they propose for ensuring greater availability of education in both official languages to all Canadians.
The unity of Canadians is often judged by the manner in which the federal and provincial governments work together for the benefit of the citizen, it is in recognition of this that the Government has recently designated a Minister of State responsible for federal-provincial relations, so that greater attention can be given to the search for harmony and co-operation between governments in Canada.
Given the new economic realities to which Canada must adjust, and the urgency of promoting linguistic and cultural harmony, it is readily apparent that Canada is now entering a new era.
It can be an era of increasing confrontation, tension and division, or an era of enhanced freedom, co-operation and unity of purpose. Fundamentally, the choice must be made by every citizen every day.
It is apparent to thoughtful Canadians everywhere that this is a time of great decisions for Canada, a time for re-discovering the strength and potential of a marvellously free and caring society.
That re-discovery will require that Canadians rededicate themselves to each other's well-being, just as I dedicate myself anew today to the people and the nation I am very proud to serve.
Members of the House of Commons,
You will be asked to consider budget proposals and to approve the expenditure of funds required for the administration of government services and programs.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May God bless and inspire all your deliberations and decisions.
