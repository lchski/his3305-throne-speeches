Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you to the first session of the twenty sixth parliament of Canada.
X am honoured today to act for His Excellency the Governor General, whose place in the respect of the Canadian people is second only to that of Her Majesty the Queen and whose early recovery to full health is sincerely wished by us all. I know that all members of this parliament would wish to join in expressing to Her Majesty the sentiments of loyalty which were recently conveyed to her by the Prime Minister.
You are deliberating the course of our country in times of great change throughout the world. These are times that test old virtues. They are times that open up new opportunities. Familiar ways of thought and action are becoming less certain guides. Many old paths are no longer open to us. The task before us is to seek out, with wisdom and imagination, those new paths that will lead us surely forward.
As Canadians we can work with hope. Our country has a proud history. Now there are expanding opportunities open to us. But they depend on our overcoming serious problems. It is only with courage and perseverance and hard work that we will achieve the better life that is within our power, for ourselves and for our children.
Our progress is the work of all the people. In a free country, we are all responsible. The determination of my ministers is that the government through its policies will contribute the leadership, the purpose, the decision that are its responsibilities to the people.

The character and strength of our nation are drawn from the diverse cultures of people who came from many lands to create the Canada that is ours today. The greater Canada that is in our power to make will be built not on uniformity but on continuing diversity, and particularly on the basic partnership of English speaking and French speaking people. My ministers are determined that the partnership shall be truly equal. For that high purpose they are establishing, in consultation with the governments of the provinces, a commission charged to study, thoroughly but urgently, how the fundamentally bicultural character of Canada may best be assured and the contribution of other cultures recognized.
To make us a more united people, the government will in all things strive to strengthen and to give new direction to our Canadian confederation. It will foster the spirit of co-operative federalism, fully respecting the rights of the provinces while safeguarding and extending the equality of opportunity which properly belongs to all Canadians in all parts of our country. In these purposes, as in others, my ministers will seek frequent consultation with the governments of the provinces.
The principles of Canadian external policy are those of the United Nations charter, to maintain peace with justice and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to promote the welfare of all peoples by international co-operation. My ministers will seek solutions to international problems by diplomacy and negotiation. In particular, my ministers will strive to lessen international tensions and halt the arms race by seeking measures of controlled disarmament, including a treaty to end nuclear tests under reasonable safeguards.
Meantime, my ministers believe that there is no alternative to the maintenance of the defences of the free nations as a deterrent to war. In particular, a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including adequate defence on the north American continent, remains essential to Canada's security. For this purpose, the armed forces of Canada should have available the modern weapons necessary to perform effectively the defensive tasks which Canada has undertaken in the alliance. Next week, we will take pleasure in welcoming to Ottawa the ministerial council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. My government is convinced that on the foundation of the present alliance a true community of the Atlantic peoples will one day be achieved.
In recent weeks the Prime Minister has had friendly and constructive discussions with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and with the President of the United States of America. By such visits and other means the government will continue to improve political and economic relationships with other countries. It is my ministers' intention to assist in enhancing the unique value of the commonwealth partnership in international relations.
Canada's economic progress is vitally dependant on vigorous economic expansion throughout the world. We must expect continuing rapid changes in international trading relationships, changes that face Canada both with problems of adjustment and with new opportunities. My ministers believe that the nations can best achieve economic progress through policies that steadily reduce the barriers limiting trade. It is equally important to pursue active policies for the economic development of the newer nations, for the expansion of trade in primary commodities at reasonably stable prices, and for the improvement of international payments.
Canada will take a constructive part in trade and other economic negotiations. In order to increase employment and production in Canada, it is the purpose of my ministers to expand Canada's export

trade, to strengthen our payments balance with other countries, and to ensure increasingly high confidence in our economy and currency.
Steady work is the basic need on which men and women depend for the well-being of themselves and their families. Unemployment, on the serious scale of recent years, is therefore the most urgent of our domestic problems. To provide the many new jobs that are needed every year, we must create new industries. The fiscal and monetary policies of the government will give priority to the encouragement of soundly based industrial expansion.
Provision will be made to assist labour and management to make manpower adjustments required by technological and other industrial changes. The special assistance for technical training will be extended in co-operation with the provinces.
Other measures will be put before you to assist in increasing production and employment in Canada.
You will be asked to provide for the early establishment of a department of industry, which will foster industrial expansion and provide a central point to which industry can look for consultation, stimulus and assistance. It will be proposed that, within the new department, there will be established an area development agency. This agency will work with the provincial governments and other organizations to co-ordinate programs for parts of the country where, because of chronic unemployment, a special thrust for development is needed.
Amendments to the Atlantic Development Board Act will be proposed, to strengthen the board and to provide for a capital assistance fund through which it can promote basic projects in the Atlantic region.
You will be asked to establish a municipal development and loan board, through which municipalities may obtain, with the approval of the provinces, loans and grants to carry out projects which will increase employment and improve services. Amendments to the National Housing Act will also be proposed.
A measure will be placed before you to establish a Canada development corporation, by means of which Canadians can more readily direct their savings to the building of new Canadian industries and to increasing the Canadian ownership of existing industries, which is one of the important objectives of the government.
A measure will be placed before you to establish an economic council of Canada, in order to assist the government, industry and labour to develop means of ensuring in Canada the highest possible levels of employment, of efficient production, and of sustained growth for our economy.
My ministers will pursue constructive policies for the development of Canada's great resources for the benefit of Canadians.
The government will undertake discussions with the government of British Columbia and with the United States, aimed at securing action on the development of the Columbia river.
A new Department of Agriculture act will be placed before you, to provide for two ministers in order that the needs of agriculture in both eastern and western Canada may receive closer attention. My ministers will institute new programs to make farming as a whole more stable and more prosperous. They will strive to expand markets for Canadian farm products both at home and abroad, with special attention to dairy products.
The government is initiating consultation with the provinces to work out a program for national fishery development. My ministers intend to secure the establishment of a twelve mile limit for the use of the Canadian fisheries, taking proper account of treaty and historic rights.
Internal Economy Commission
You will be asked to continue the existing payments to the railways, pending the approval of long-term measures concerning transportation. You will be asked to provide additional assistance for the completion of the trans-Canada highway.
My ministers have undertaken to establish a comprehensive system of contributory pensions. The new pensions will be co-ordinated with the existing provisions for old-age security, for the purpose of enabling all Canadians to retire in security and with dignity. While the arrangements required for this great advance in the social security of our people are necessarily complex, the legislation submitted to you will be designed to make the new pension plan operative as soon as possible.
Legislation on unemployment insurance is under consideration and in the meantime you will be asked to ensure that the fund is sustained to meet the claims on it.
The redistribution of electoral districts is overdue. You will be asked to authorize the establishment of a commission to undertake this important task.
A change in the Citizenship Act will be proposed to ensure full equality of rights for all Canadian citizens wherever they were bom. Immigration policy will be reviewed.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by parliament.
You will be invited to establish a special committee of the house to examine defence problems.
It will be proposed that the standing committee on privileges and elections review the Canada Elections Act.
You will be asked to agree to the establishment of a committee on procedure, over which the Speaker will preside, with the aim of strengthening parliament and making it more effective.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In addition to the measures already specified, you will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
May divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
