Ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
It is my great pleasure to greet you on this, the first day of the Thirty-fourth Parliament since Confederation. This ceremony is rich in history, custom, tradition and symbolism. It is also a renewal of the vital relationship among Crown, people, parliament and government that, today as in the past, is the essence of Canadian democracy.
The people have spoken in a general election three weeks ago. Their members in the House of Commons have today claimed from the Crown the ancient rights and privileges that enable them to carry out their responsibilities.
In the election, my government sought and received a mandate for its policies, including the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States that is to take effect on January 1, 1989. The purpose of this early session of the Thirty-fourth Parliament is to seek your approval for legislation to implement this Agreement as scheduled. Similar legislation was passed by the House of Commons in August. It had also received approval in principle in the Senate and had reached the stage of Senate committee study, prior to dissolution of the Thirty-third Parliament.
My government is determined to secure the benefits of economic opportunity for this and future generations of Canadians. This Agreement reflects my ministers' confidence in Canada's ability to compete with the best in the world.
In due course, we will hold a second session of the Parliament, at which time my ministers will place before you a statement of policy for this, their second mandate in office. Meanwhile, you may be asked at the present session to consider other matters as deemed advisable by my government.
Ladies and gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,
Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:
As you carry out the will of the people and serve the national interest, may Divine Providence be your guide and inspiration.
