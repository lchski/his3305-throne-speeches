Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the fourth session of the thirtieth Parliament of Canada.
During the course of the past summer Her Majesty The Queen came to visit Newfoundland and Saskatchewan, and to open the Commonwealth Games. She joined all Canadians in congratulating the thousands of volunteer workers who helped make the Games so successful, and with all of us she applauded the remarkable achievements of Canadian athletes at Edmonton.
The Duke of Edinburgh visited British Columbia as well, where His Royal Highness took part in the two hundredth anniversary observance of Captain Cook's voyage to the Pacific coast.

My wife and I paid an official visit to the King and Queen of Spain, who welcomed us most hospitably. Through us, Spain expressed its friendship and high regard for all Canadians.
As the end of my term of office approaches, my wife and I would like to thank parliamentarians and the people of Canada for the respect and affection which they have extended to us on countless occasions over the years.
We wish also to express our love for Canada. A great country is not created without difficulty, but to see it develop and grow stronger despite every obstacle has been for us a source of great joy and pride. Our faith in the future of Canada is stronger than it has ever been.
I: Urgent Action Needed
Parliament begins today a new session which will concentrate upon Canada's two most pressing needs. They are the strengthening of our economy, and the renewal of our federation.
Those two inseparable imperatives are different expressions of the same goal: to strengthen Canada through unity: to unify Canada through economic strength.
Seldom in the past have the seriousness of the challenge, the strength of our national will, and the scope of our opportunities combined to create for Canada a moment in history so full of potential for good. Such a moment, if ignored, may not soon come again. That is one reason why you should approach your task with urgency.
Another is the legitimate expectation of the people of Canada in these difficult times. They expect their parliament to respond to their most urgent needs with insight, with action, and with a minimum of delay.
You will therefore be asked to focus your efforts upon the priority areas of the economy and the renewal of the federation.
To that end, the government has prepared over the past few months a detailed plan of action. It is designed to increase confidence in the essential health and potential of the economy, and to strengthen the bonds which unite us in one Canadian community.
II: Economic Policy Background
The economic initiatives announced by the Government in August will intensify the assault upon unemployment and inflation.
Those initiatives will further restrain government spending, stimulate economic growth, and give more assistance to those in need. They carry forward commitments made by the government in 1976 with the publication of The Way Ahead. Many of those commitments were endorsed by the First Ministers' Conference in February of this year.
First Ministers agreed to help the private sector to lead the way toward accelerated economic growth. They also reached agreement on important medium-term economic objectives.
In July of this year, Canada was a participant in the Bonn Summit Conference. There the leaders of the major industrialized countries of the free world planned a co-operative strategy against inflation, unemployment and slow growth.
Canada pledged at Bonn to do its part to restore vitality to the Canadian and world economies. After the conference, that pledge was transformed into action in a series of policy announcements.
They require action on two fronts. The first requirement is to further reduce the growth rate of federal spending.
The second is to pare down or eliminate many worthwhile but low-priority programs, in order to free the dollars necessary for a serious assault upon high-priority goals. These goals are to stimulate industrial expansion, put more Canadians back to work, and further protect from the impact of inflation those who are least able to protect themselves.

III: Expenditure Restraint
Let us examine the first of these requirements, restraint in government spending. To achieve sustained progress in the battle against inflation, the government believes it is absolutely essential for Canadians to practise restraint in their price and income demands. The government is also aware of its own responsibilities. Expenditure restraint has been a central theme of federal policy and practice since October, 1975. It was reinforced by the First Ministers'joint commitment in February to contain government spending below the trend growth rate of the Gross National Product.
In August, the government set itself a more ambitious restraint objective. Planned federal spending this fiscal year will be reduced by five hundred million dollars, and next year's projected spending will be reduced by two billion dollars. As a result, the projected rate of expenditure growth during the next fiscal year is 8.9 percent. That is well below the forecast growth of 11 percent for the GNP.
The objectives of imposing more severe restraint on government spending are two.
The first is to encourage a more vigorous expansion of the private sector by reducing governments' share of the nation's wealth.
The second is to create a leaner and more efficient government, by making every tax dollar do more work.
The government is committed to reducing the size of the federal public service. You will be asked to approve amendments to the Public Service Superannuation Act, designed to ensure that public service pensions are in line with the level of contributions.
The government is committed to continued wage restraint in the public sector. You will be asked to approve amendments to the Public Service Staff Relations Act to ensure that compensation in the federal public service remains in step with the private sector, and does not lead the way.
You will also be asked to enact legislation making the Post Office a Crown Corporation, with a view to making postal services more efficient and responsive to public needs.
Because such a large portion of the federal budget is dedicated to transfer payments to the provinces, no large-scale restraint program could be successful without their co-operation. The government intends to negotiate reductions which will cause a minimum of difficulty for provincial governments.
You will be asked to consider amendments to the National Housing Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act, and other legislation in order to give effect to the program of expenditure restraint.
IV: Shifting Dollars To Priority Needs
The second major requirement is to transfer funds from lower-priority to high-priority goals. They are industrial expansion, job creation, and more assistance for those in need.
Providing those additional resources within the context of budgetary restraint is a most difficult and painful exercise. Worthwhile programs serving real needs must be cut back if the money is to be found for more pressing requirements.

By cutting back programs in virtually every department, the government intends to channel one billion dollars into programs of economic and social development.
In the area of economic development, the Government's recent proposals are intended to build upon its earlier initiatives to promote job creation, stimulate private sector growth, and encourage industrial innovation. Those initiatives included the April budget, which cut sales taxes in co-operation with the provinces, and provided a stimulus to non-conventional oil development.
Other measures were announced during June and July to encourage energy conservation and the development of renewable energy sources; to stimulate research and development; and to assist small businesses.

Now the government proposes to devote more resources to the promotion of industrial development in 1979-80.
The primary objective is to help establish an economic climate which is conducive to private sector growth, particularly in the areas of high technology industries, regional development, and the promotion of exports. Additional assistance will be provided for tourism and for the resource and ship-building industries.
Excessive government intervention in the economy should be greatly reduced over time by initiatives to eliminate duplication between federal and provincial programs and to simplify regulatory and reporting systems.
An important element among the government's proposed new industrial development priorities is an increase in support for major capital projects in manufacturing, energy and transportation.
The major thrust of the government's employment strategy is to encourage the creation of permanent jobs in the private sector. Special emphasis is being placed on the training and job placement of young Canadians.
In this new session, the government will take action to increase support for the training of an adequate supply of skilled labour and to assist labour market mobility.
The government also proposes to introduce major changes in the Unemployment Insurance Program. These changes would achieve a substantial reduction in the cost of the program. They are intended to minimize any negative effects which the program may have on the incentive to work, or on the labour supply.
The proposed adjustments would make the program more selective in its coverage. They would also put Unemployment Insurance funds to more productive use, partly to finance an expanded Job Experience Training Program for youth. You will be asked to approve amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act to give effect to these changes.
Other new employment strategy measures will focus upon year-round employment programs for young people. A new Youth Job Corps Program will be created. This and other youth employment programs will benefit from a major increase in funding during this fiscal year.
In the field of social policy, the unfair impact of inflation upon lower-income groups calls for further protection.
The most effective way to protect Canadians against the injustices of inflation is to continue to act vigorously to bring inflation down. This requires the co-operation of everyone, and takes time. But the poor cannot wait for that. Nor can lower-income parents with children to support, nor elderly pensioners. We must give them additional help now because their need is urgent.
The Child Benefits System has therefore been redesigned. Family allowance payments will be set at a base rate of $20 per month per child for 1979, so that more aid can be provided to those whose need is greatest. The base rate will be indexed in line with the cost of living after 1979.
Funds saved through this process wili be used to provide a yearly payment of $200 per child to mothers in low and middle-income families. Also, there will be an increase of $20 per household in the monthly Guaranteed Income Supplement. This will further protect the elderly from the impact of inflation.
You will therefore be asked to consider amendments to the Family Allowance Act, the Old Age Security Act, and the Income Tax Act.
As an additional anti-inflationary measure, the government has recently reduced the special excise tax on gasoline by three cents a gallon. Negotiations are under way with the government of Alberta to defer the one dollar per barrel increase in the price of oil scheduled for January first.
V: Renewal of The Federation
Economic improvement by itself, however, will not guarantee a united country. A renewal of the Canadian federation is equally essential. It was with this conviction that the Government published its proposals for renewal last June in a document entitled A Time for Action. Later that month, the government placed before parliament the Constitutional Amendment bill. It was referred to a Special Joint Committee of Parliament as a basis for a full public discussion of constitutional change.
A Time for Action affirmed the government's commitment to four basic principles of renewal: the preeminence of citizens and their freedoms; full respect of native rights; full development of Canada's two major linguistic communities; and the enhancement of our mosaic of cultures. It supported development of the regional economies and the fostering of economic integration, so all in Canada can share the benefits of our country more equally. Finally, it recognized the interdependence of the two orders of government, and urged the clear establishment of their respective roles in a renewed Constitution.
A Time For Action stressed the need for a less contentious relationship among the federal and provincial governments, and more effective intergovernmental consultation. Other goals are freedom of action for each government to fulfil its responsibilities, and measures to permit greater accountability by governments to their legislatures and the people who elect them. Also emphasized was the need to help the taxpayers better understand the intergovernmental process; and to provide more effective services at less cost by eliminating wasteful duplication.
The government therefore proposed to the provincial governments that joint action should begin as soon as possible on the clarification of federal and provincial roles and the elimination of duplication. The premiers have responded positively. The First Ministers' Conference on the Constitution, now expected to take place at the end of this month, will consider how best to launch this major enterprise.
With respect to the reform of the constitution, the government has set out only two fundamental requirements. The new constitution must provide for Canada to continue as a genuine federation, and it must contain a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including linguistic rights. The government has shown its deep concern that real progress toward change soon be achieved, so that uncertainty can be dispelled and unity reinforced. In particular, the government believes it essential that clear and important progress be made before Quebeckers are asked by their provincial government to vote in a referendum about their future

Because there has been some misunderstanding about two important features of constitutional renewal, the government wishes to make its position clear once again. The first is the role of the Monarch and the Governor General. The government's view was and remains that the new constitution should describe the situation as it exists today in Canada, and the government is pleased that the provincial premiers expressed the same view during their meeting in Regina. Discussions are already in progress with provincial goverments to ensure that the legal drafting conforms to that intention. There is no intention to change or to reduce in any way the role Her Majesty plays.
Secondly, the government recognizes that the distribution of powers among federal and provincial governments is an essential part of the renewal of the constitution.
The government is prepared to begin the study of the distribution of powers at the same time as that of institutions and rights, and to give every aspect of the work a high and urgent priority. Discussions will begin at the meeting of First Ministers later this month.
However, the government believes that proposals on institutions and rights can be dealt with more rapidly than the distribution of powers, and that action on the former should not be held up if prolonged discussion is needed to settle the latter.
The public hearings of the Task Force on Canadian Unity have provided a valuable forum in which ideas could be brought forward and discussed. The government is therefore confident that the report of the Task Force will be an important contribution to the process of renewal.

In the course of the present session, the government will be introducing in Parliament a revised constitution bill. With goodwill and flexibility on all sides, and with the shape of Canada's future at stake, the government is confident that concrete progress will be achieved in the course of this session.
Neither renewal of the federation nor the maturity of our national structure can be considered complete until the achievement of an amending procedure permits our constitution to be vested finally and entirely in Canadian hands. In co-operation with the provinces, the government will again address itself to that question in the new session.
VI: Social Responsibility and Openness of Government
The government reaffirms its view that a renewal of faith in Canada requires an active and informed Canadian public.
It is therefore intended to continue consultations with business and labour, private interest groups, and other levels of government.
In addition, you will be asked to consider proposals to increase public access to government information.
In the further promotion of open and efficient government, a proposal will be placed before you to provide for the review by parliament of evaluations by the government of major programs.
You will also be asked to consider legislation to create a federal Ombudsman. You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.
Members of the House of Commons,
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and expenditures authorized by parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,
May divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
