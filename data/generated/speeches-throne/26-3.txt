Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you to the third session of the twenty sixth Parliament of Canada.
We recall with pleasure the presence last October of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. The visit of Her Majesty to Charlottetown, Quebec and Ottawa helped us to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the interprovincial conferences that led to Confederation. It also reaffirmed in the hearts of Canadians the cherished place of the monarchy in our national development. The gracious presence and the wise words of the Queen of Canada helped to strengthen the unity of our country and to rededicate Canadians to the sense of purpose that joins us in the pursuit of our common goals as Canadians while leaving us free to develop to the full the facets of our life which reflect the duality of our foundation and the variety of our development.
The international situation gives ground for concern. The stability of South-east Asia is threatened by a deepening crisis in Viet Nam and continued pressures on Malaysia. The United Nations is beset by conflicting political pressures which have seriously impaired its capacity for executive action. The continuance of these situations, and of the policies that have given rise to them, would create serious risks of widening conflict.
My Government is resolved that Canada shall make the fullest contribution it can to the lessening of international tensions, including the pro-
vision of practical assistance to developing countries. In the forthcoming negotiations on the United Nations crisis, the objective of my Ministers will be to contribute to the work of repairing and strengthening the United Nations in order that it may play its proper role in the preservation of world peace and security. My Government will press forward its efforts to assure effective international action for peace keeping and to move toward general disarmament under effective international control. Canada will continue meantime to play its full part in the strengthening of collective defence and in the close collaboration of NATO members on both sides of the Atlantic.
My Government will continue to contribute to the development of the Commonwealth ties which are of major importance to the free world and to the improvement of relations between the continents. My Prime Minister will attend the forthcoming Conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers which will discuss, among other things, the expansion of trade and the establishment of a Commonwealth Secretariat.
My Ministers attach great importance to Canada's neighbourly relationship with the United States and to the development of practical, mutually beneficial arrangements within that relationship. You will be asked to approve a resolution concerning the important agreement on the automobile industry recently concluded with the United States. Members of the House of Commons:
My Ministers believe that it is imperative to reform the procedures of the House of Commons in order that it may accomplish the large volume of work required to meet the needs of the Canadian people in modern times. My Ministers therefore will submit to you proposals for reform, based both on the valuable work of your committee on procedure and organization and on my Government's study of the procedures which, in the Parliaments at Westminster and elsewhere, have enabled effective debate and criticism to be combined with effective dispatch of public business.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
My Ministers will continue their policy of promoting the strength and unity of the Canadian Confederation. This policy has made possible the achievement and reinforcement on a nation wide basis of programs, in pensions and in other fields, which would not have been attainable but for better procedures of consultation and concerted action with due regard for the federal character of our country. My Ministers will continue to improve the procedures and practices involved in the federal relationship so that all Canadians may feel equally served by Confederation.
After the appropriate provincial concurrence has been signified, you will be asked to approve an Address to the Queen to provide that the constitution of Canada may be amended in Canada by the procedures which have been agreed between my Government and the Governments of all the Provinces.
You will be asked to authorize my Government to provide that "O Canada" shall be the National Anthem of Canada and that "God Save the Queen" shall be recognized as the Royal Anthem in Canada.
Our country is achieving a high rate of economic growth. Trade is expanding. With growing industrialization, Canadians are enjoying rapidly increasing employment opportunities; incomes and living standards are rising; the number of people out

of work has been reduced to lower levels than for many years.
All the great potentialities of our economy are not, however, being realized. The talents of some of our people are wasted because of poverty, illness, inadequate education and training, inequality in opportunities for work. To combat these problems, to improve the opportunities of people who are now at a disadvantage, is to put new power into economic expansion and to enhance the unity of our country.
My Government therefore is developing a program for the full utilisation of our human resources and the elimination of poverty among our people. It will include improved measures for regional development, the re-employment and training of workers, the redevelopment of rural areas, the assistance of needy people, the renewal of areas now blighted and congested in our cities, and the establishment of new opportunities for young Canadians. Besides strengthening and broadening measures within the federal sphere of responsibility, the plan will be designed to concert them more effectively with provincial programs. Because of the importance of this plan, my Prime Minister will take direct responsibility for its co-ordination, assisted by a special secretariat. My Government will propose the calling of a special federal-provincial conference to seek full co-operation and co-ordination with policies of the Provinces.
As one of the major elements in this plan, my Government's area development program, which has already been of substantial assistance to industrial expansion in areas of high unemployment, will be expanded, in consultation with the Provinces, to other areas where incomes are low. You will be asked to approve measures to aid industrial expansion in these areas and to help people to take full advantage of such improved employment opportunities.
My Government will also propose improved measures to assist the re-employment of workers displaced by automation or affected by other economic changes. These measures to develop our country's human resources will include grants and loans for workers moving to new jobs, improved training programs in industry, extended vocational services particularly for the longer term unemployed, and an expanded program for agricultural manpower. These measures will be taken in co-operation with management and labour and, where appropriate, in conjunction with the Provinces.
You will be asked to approve the creation of a fund for rural economic development and, in order to provide for fuller integration of action for rural development, amendments to the legislation regarding ARDA will be placed before you.
You will be asked to approve the establishment of a Company of Young Canadians, through which the energies and talents of youth can be enlisted in projects for economic and social development both in Canada and abroad.
After further discussions between my Government and the Provinces, you will also be asked to enact a measure to establish a Canada Assistance Plan, providing for federal sharing in the cost of comprehensive programs under which people can be assisted on the basis of their need.
My Government believes that public policy should be directed to improving the quality of health services and to ensuring that all Canadians can obtain needed health care, irrespective of their ability to pay. Accordingly my Government will at an early date meet with the Governments of the Provinces in order to discuss with them the way in which federal and provincial action can most effectively contribute to programs that will provide health services to Canadians on a comprehensive basis.
My Government will propose the re-establishment of a special committee of the House of Commons on food and drugs, and will facilitate its work with the aim of reducing the prices paid by the public for drugs.
My Government is developing new policies to enable farmers generally to achieve larger and more reliable incomes so that their living and working standards will be comparable to those enjoyed in other sectors of our economy. You will be asked to consider measures of special assistance to the family farm in both eastern and western Canada.
My Government's recent action to raise the incomes of dairy farmers will be followed by a comprehensive measure to make possible the development, in co-operation with the Provinces, of new national policies for major farm products, including the establishment of a Canadian Dairy Commission. Action will be taken to improve the movement and marketing of feed grain in eastern Canada and British Columbia.
In order to raise the level of income of Canadian fishermen, a measure will be placed before you to provide for an expanded national fisheries development program.
In order to improve the position of veterans, you will be asked to approve measures to amend the Veterans' Land Act, the Children of War Dead (Education Assistance) Act, the War Veterans' Allowance Act and the Army Benevolent Fund Act.
A measure will be placed before you to amend the Canadian Citizenship Act, particularly in order to ensure full equality of rights for all Canadian citizens wherever they were born.
You will be asked to approve a revision of the Immigration Act in the light of a white paper which will be placed before you, reviewing immigration policy and procedures.
You will be asked to enact legislation to establish an Indian Claims Commission.
A measure to establish an age of retirement from the Senate will be placed before you.
My Government will seek to provide more encouragement to the cultural development of our country. You will be asked to consider a measure to strengthen the position of Canadian publications, amendments to the legislation dealing with broadcasting, and a measure to help the development of a feature film industry in Canada.
In order to encourage the progress of scientific research in Canada you will be asked to enact legislation to establish a Science Council of Canada. You will also be asked to authorize a program for the advancement of industrial technology, designed to make our industry more competitive and efficient.
Arrangements will be made for you to decide the issue of capital punishment. My Government will appoint a special committee to study and make recommendations on a comprehensive policy for the correction and rehabilitation of prisoners.
My Government will appoint a Royal Commission to study the status, form and procedures of adjudicative and regulatory bodies and to investigate the desirability of instituting a parliamentary commissioner or Ombudsman for Canada.
My Government intends to make proposals regarding the limitation and payment of election
Speech from the Throne expenses when it has received and considered the findings of the committee of inquiry.
You will be asked to consider revisions of the Bank Act, the Quebec Savings Banks Act and the Bank of Canada Act; legislation will be proposed to establish a Canada Development Corporation to assist in financing major new industrial developments and in increasing Canadian ownership of business corporations.
My Government will propose a revision of legislation on unemployment insurance; legislation to provide for safety in employment under federal jurisdiction; amendment of the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act to achieve consistency with the labour standards code; legislation to make collective bargaining and arbitration available to the Public Service; and legislation revising federal superannuation and pension plans to integrate them with the Canada Pension Plan.
You will be asked to consider comprehensive legislation to reform public regulation of the railways and to facilitate the adaptation of the railway system to present and future needs; a measure to provide for the recapitalization of the Canadian National Railways; and amendments to the Aeronautics Act.
Other legislative proposals which you will be asked to consider will include: amendments to the Financial Administration Act to establish the Treasury Board under the presidency of a Minister to be named the president of the Treasury Board; legislation regarding Term 29 of the Union with Newfoundland; a measure regarding conservation of oil and gas under federal jurisdiction; amendments to the Post Office Act, the National Housing Act, the Atlantic Development Board Act, the Northwest Territories Act, the Bankruptcy Act and other legislation.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to appropriate the funds required for the services and payments authorized by Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
