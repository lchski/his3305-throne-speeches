Members of the House of Commons:
I welcome you as you foregather to resume your parliamentary duties.
All Canadians look forward with the greatest pleasure to the forthcoming visit to Canada of Her Gracious Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness, the Prince Philip, on the occasion of the official opening of the St. Lawrence seaway. It is particularly gratifying that Her Majesty also plans to visit all the provinces and the two territories in order to meet her Canadian subjects in many parts of our country.
Canada's close relations with the other countries of the commonwealth, and the sense of community of interest within this association of free nations itself, have been confirmed and vitalized by the recent visit of my Prime Minister to the commonwealth capitals of the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. These consultations between heads of government provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on international questions, on the possibilities for expanding trade and on other problems of mutual concern.
Canadians recognize that the most pressing need of all nations is an enduring peace. My government will continue to work steadfastly and in a spirit of genuine co-operation towards the settlement of outstanding issues which threaten that peace.
My ministers are concerned over recent developments in the Berlin situation. They deplore the attempt by the Soviet union to abrogate unilaterally the interallied agreements relating to Berlin, and they believe that the freedom of West Berlin must be assured pending agreement on the establishment of a united and free Germany.
My ministers have been pleased to note that some advance has been made during the past year in the vital field of disarmament. The drafting of an agreement for the discontinuance of nuclear weapons tests is a hopeful beginning.
It is Canada's desire that the scientific achievements which now have made possible the penetration of outer space should be a blessing to all mankind. My government is convinced that international agreement must be reached without delay to ensure that outer space is used only for peaceful purposes with full co-operation among all nations.
In concert with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Canada has reaffirmed its determination to maintain and improve the power of the alliance as a deterrent against aggression. You will be asked to provide for maintaining the effective power of Canada's defence forces. The importance of the alliance was re-emphasized by the visit of my Prime Minister to the United Kingdom, France, West Germany and Italy. His consultations with the heads of government in those countries included trade and economic policies, as well as the more general questions confronting the alliance.
Discussions are taking place with the government of the United States to enable Canadian industry to share in the production of equipment being procured by the United States for joint defence purposes. [Mr. DiefenbakerJ
My ministers continue to recognize the necessity of providing economic assistance to underdeveloped nations. Approval will be sought for the appropriations needed for this purpose, so that Canada may play its full part in helping the emerging states of Asia and Africa, particularly those in the commonwealth.
My ministers expect that the increases which have been proposed in the resources of the international bank and the international monetary fund will be approved by the votes of the member countries and when that has occurred you will be asked to approve the necessary legislation to implement these important measures for improving the facilities for financing world trade and economic development.
In response to suggestions put forward by my government, a commonwealth trade and economic conference was held in Montreal last September. This meeting, one of the most important in the history of the commonwealth, was attended by ministers representing the self-governing nations of the commonwealth and the countries now looking forward to obtaining full sovereignty. A large measure of agreement was reached on trade and economic matters. This has led to far-reaching decisions on the part of the United Kingdom and other countries to restore convertibility of their currencies and to remove restrictions on imports.
My government has taken action to reduce unemployment by expediting national works programs, by programs undertaken in co-operation with the provinces, and by encouraging Canadians generally to undertake constructive activities particularly in the winter season. You will be asked to assist the municipalities of Canada in the financing of work on construction projects which would not otherwise have been undertaken during the winter months.
Certain amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act will be submitted to you.
My government welcomes the evidence of recovery from the recession and will continue to foster and assist this improvement. They believe that as recovery proceeds there will be increasing need for care to preserve the stability and purchasing power of our currency.
My government will continue in its economic policies to lay emphasis upon national development. My ministers believe that by the wise use of the resources with which nature has endowed this country, Canadians can achieve a continually rising standard of living. My government will therefore foster and encourage the proper development and use of these resources and the growth of efficient industry based upon them. Many projects for national development have already been put in hand; you will be asked to vote the supply necessary to continue these projects and to initiate others.
Additional legislation in the field of agriculture will be recommended. A measure will be laid before you to institute a system of crop insurance in co-operation with such provinces as so desire. You will also be invited to make a comprehensive review and revision of the legislation concerning farm credit, in order that credit may be more effective in assisting in the development and maintenance of an efficient and prosperous agriculture.
You will be asked to enact a bill of rights which will make manifest the intent that fundamental rights and freedoms shall prevail and remain inviolate in all matters within the competence of parliament.
At the earliest opportunity you will be invited to authorize the establishment of a national energy

board to ensure, so far as it lies within the jurisdiction of parliament, that Canada's energy resources are used effectively and prudently to the best advantage of Canadians.
My ministers have been gratified to see the alltime record in house construction which has been made possible by government loans under the National Housing Act. They will recommend to you further amendments to that act to continue this program and to encourage the flow of private funds into mortgages.
For the purpose of increasing the range and effectiveness of the guarantees provided for financing exports, you will be asked to make certain amendments to the Export Credits Insurance Act.
My government will place before you certain amendments to the laws respecting trade practices.
You will be asked to consider a bill containing numerous amendments to the Canada Shipping Act.
My government will request your approval of its participation in a contributory plan to provide medical benefits for civil servants pursuant to recommendations of the national joint council of the public service.
A comprehensive review of the provisions of the Veterans' Land Act will be proposed and amendments to ensure that veteran farmers also can take greater advantage of modern agricultural practices. Amendments to the Veterans Rehabilitation Act and the War Service Grants Act will also be recommended.
My government will recommend an amendment to the Federal-Provincial Tax-Sharing Arrangements Act to extend for another year the increase made last year in the provincial share of personal income tax revenue.
My government proposes that the entire subject of financial relations between the dominion and the provinces shall receive continued active co-operative study. All provincial governments are being asked to agree to the use, for this purpose, of the machinery of the existing federal-provincial continuing committee on fiscal and economic matters working under the direction of a committee consisting of the Minister of Finance and all provincial treasurers.
My ministers will recommend to you action to alleviate the discriminatory effects of the recent horizontal increase in freight rates.
Recommendations for a number of changes in the Criminal Code will be placed before you including some to strengthen the provisions respecting obscene literature.
My ministers will propose to you measures to revise the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act and to revise and consolidate the relevant pension provisions.
You will be asked to approve a statute to authorize the appointment of parliamentary secretaries to ministers of the crown.
My government will put forward a resolution to establish a joint committee of both houses to review the Indian Act and the administration of Indian affairs.
A recommendation will be placed before you for a statute to continue on a permanent basis the supplementary pensions for retired civil servants, members of the armed services and of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that were provided on an interim basis by an appropriation last year.
My ministers will recommend an increase in the total funds that may be expended under the Trans-Canada Highway Act.
You will be asked to revise the Seeds Act, to approve and implement by statute an agreement with the province of New Brunswick concerning Indian lands, and to extend the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act for a further three years.
You will also be asked to amend the Northwest Territories Act, the Public Lands Grants Act, the National Defence Act, the Defence Services Pension Act, the Broadcasting Act, the Public Servants Inventions Act and certain other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons:
You will be invited to establish a special committee of the house to review broadcasting policy and operations.
It will be proposed that the standing committee on privileges and elections review the elections act in preparation for subsequent legislation.
It will also be proposed that the question of ensuring the use of humane methods in the slaughtering of animals be referred to the standing committee on agriculture for consideration.
You will be asked to appropriate the sums required for carrying on the government of Canada during the next fiscal year.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence bless you and guide you in your duties.
