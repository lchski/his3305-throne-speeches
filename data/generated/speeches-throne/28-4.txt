Honourable Members of the Senate:

Members of the House of Commons:

This reunion of your two Houses with the Representative of the Crown marks the beginning of the 4th Session of the 28th Parliament of Canada.

Before proceeding to the business of the new Session I should like to thank you in the name of our Queen and on behalf of all Canadians for your efforts and accomplishments during the long 3rd Session which began the 8th of October 1970 and was concluded only yesterday.

During that period there was a continuing celebration of centennials connected with the foundation of the Canadian Confederation. Manitoba and the Northwest Territories concluded ceremonies which marked the 100th anniversary of their incorporation into the Dominion. The admission of British Columbia, which gave Canada its place on the Pacific Ocean, was commemorated in 1971 with much enthusiasm and a multitude of ceremonies and projects. As in the year before, our gracious Queen and other members of the Royal Family marked the event with an extensive tour, much to the delight of British Columbians and Canadians generally.

It gave my wife and me much satisfaction to take official part on several occasions in the British Columbia celebrations, as well as to travel abroad on behalf of Canada to The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Iran, in response to invitations from the heads of these States so well disposed towards Canada.

Since last I addressed you some 16 months ago, events in Canada and elsewhere have continued to demonstrate the turbulence of this age of changing values and shifting attitudes. We have witnessed with sadness outbursts of violence beyond our shores as despairing men and women have chosen to settle their differences through the use of force, extending in some cases to actual war. We have witnessed as well a period of international economic uncertainty which affected all of the industrialized nations of the world and which has made us increasingly aware of our dependence on a strong economic base in the pursuit of our social goals.

We learned in months gone by that Canada was not immune from internal pressures. In October, 1970 one of the most difficult national challenges in many years was met calmly, with discipline, and with the strong support of the people of Canada. There were sad moments but there were also memorable examples of resoluteness and courage.

More recently, we learned from another type of challenge, this time of an economic nature and coming from without rather than within, that Canada and Canadians possessed the stamina and the resilience to overcome this form of adversity as well.

Throughout, pressures for change around the world emphasized to us that the excitement and the promise of modern technological achievements become hollow and mocking to those who find in society little understanding of their hopes and little provision for their needs. In a period dominated by bigness, in an increasingly impersonal social system, one of the major challenges facing government is to remove the impression of isolation which so often surrounds men and women, depriving them of their sense of worth, of accomplishment, of fulfilment, and removing from them their identity as individuals.

Isolation takes many forms in Canada-physical distance, social stigma, economic deprival. In each of those forms it represents a degree of rejection, of exclusion, of estrangement. This country fails in its essential purpose if it does not ensure that its most precious resource, human talent, is not wasted away. Our challenge is to remove the barriers that create isolation, to permit each Canadian to detect-even if not always able to fulfil-his own potential, to ensure that his image of Canada is one of promise and compassion.

Every one of us is enriched through involvement in this stimulating process we call Canada. Our goals and hopes are bound up in the restlessness and vitality of this rich land. We in this place have a special responsibility to help bring these goals and those hopes within reach, to make real the Canada of which our forefathers dreamed: a land so large that some of it will remain always serene and unspoiled; a society which believes in the dignity of every single individual; a community which husbands its resources and shares them justly among this generation and those to follow; an enterprise which permits and provokes each Canadian to contribute his skills and his talents.

There will be opportunity in this session of this parliament to pursue these ends. The Government will lay before you proposals to continue the development of our national wealth, to deal more compassionately with those in our midst who require help, to involve more Canadians in the ferment and satisfaction of community activities, to protect our natural heritage, and to strengthen our sense of identity and our image of ourselves.

Economic security is one of the most effective forces with which to counter social isolation. Job opportunities must be found and income uncertainties overcome if all Canadians are to share in the richness of this land. To permit the protection and enhancement of those values and those rights which distinguish Canada as a human place, a sound economy is absolutely essential. The attainment of such an economy retains a high priority in the Government's continuing programme. The social phenomenon of economic instability is present today in every industrialized country. We are fortunate that its ill effects have been less pronounced in Canada than elsewhere. Our success in increasing our real gross national product, in the creation of new jobs, and in the maintenance of price stability has been achieved through a policy which encourages an economic environment within which business and all elements of society are able to benefit. At the same time the Government has worked to strengthen and promote the economies of the less developed regions of Canada. Simultaneously, a range of programmes has been introduced to deal with the specific problems of those localities and individuals affected by unemployment at different times of the year.

Unemployment continues to be a matter of intense concern to the Government and will remain a primary focus of attention and action. Co-operation with the business and industrial communities will be extended even further to ensure a favourable business climate. As the economy continues to gain momentum, the private sector will be able increasingly to provide jobs for those Canadians in need of them. The Government will nevertheless redouble its efforts to make sure that as many jobs as possible are available and that the fullest possible use is made of the skills and initiatives of those who are seeking work. It will at the same time continue to exert its influence to prevent the erosion of incomes through the maintenance of reasonably stable prices of the goods and services required by Canadians.

Our economy is dependent, as are the economies of all industrialized countries, on the imagination of entrepreneurs and their use of research and innovation, as well as upon a rational industrial strategy. You will be informed in months to come of government proposals for improved policies in these areas which will be of immense importance to the long term development of our country: of policies for the use of science and technology designed to contribute not only to industry but to the qualitative improvement of the life of Canadians, of an industrial strategy prepared for the peculiar character of the Canadian economy. The basis of each will be spelled out as the session proceeds.

For more than a decade an issue which has attracted increasing interest and growing debate in this country has been that of the control of our economic environment. The debate has emphasized the dual aspects of Canada's identity and of economic benefit for Canadians. Further steps will be taken towards the resolution of this issue.

These policy proposals have been designed with a blend of realism and imagination, as Canada itself was designed more than a century ago. They are intended to permit this country to attain a degree of leadership and independence in selected fields of endeavour while reducing overall Canadian vulnerability to events both expected and unexpected from beyond our shores.

A further imperative in the structuring of strong, internationally competitive industry is the development of a modern and workable competition policy. The development of such a policy, designed to achieve an efficient and innovative economy, capable of rapid growth and dynamic change, must proceed through consultation with all sectors of Canadian society. During the coming weeks the Government will continue this consultative process and will place before Parliament a revised policy reflecting the informed and constructive comments received and assistance gained.

A major factor in the strength of the Canadian economy is provided by exports. The Government will pursue vigorously the initiatives it has taken throughout the world to develop and maintain Canadian markets. Those advantages already gained by ministerial missions to other countries will be enlarged in a number of ways. One of these will involve the provision of better credit facilities. The private financial sector will be encouraged to involve itself increasingly in export financing. The Government will continue to develop programmes to strengthen secondary industry. Closer scientific and technological co-operation with other countries can be expected. Trade negotiations will seek to enlarge opportunities for Canadian manufacturers and the consultative machinery with the European Economic Community and its member states will be strengthened. Negotiations will continue with the United States so as to extend the benefits gained by each member of the world's most important trading partnership.

Policies designed to promote a related, yet distinct, sector of the economy-tourism, will be revealed in coming weeks.

A basic building block in the growth of Canada's national wealth has been the performance of our resource and energy industries. Over the years they have opened new frontiers and stimulated the development of the sinews and muscles of Canada; they have accumulated capital for reinvestment, enhanced the scientific and technical skills of Canadians, and accounted for a healthy export surplus. A continuation and strengthening of government-industry relations is necessary in order that such areas of challenge as environmental impact and the increasing demand both within Canada and abroad for resources and energy be fully addressed.

The competitive requirements for northern development will continue to be recognized; development will not be permitted at the expense of the northern peoples and the northern environment. To ensure the involvement of the residents of the north, and their participation in the design of their own future, there will be continued support for the development of local government in the northern territories.

Canada's primary food producers-our farmers and our fishermen-form one of the traditional and still basic strengths of our economy. Their continued productivity and livelihood is of immense importance to the Government and to the country. Improvements and achievements of the past several months will be strengthened and continued. Measures already undertaken and which have substantially improved prices to fishermen-upwards of 50 percent in some cases-will be extended, ensuring that the benefits of price support for fish products go to the fishermen themselves. Wheat farmers will be assured of an increased return equivalent to the higher price for wheat consumed as food by Canadians. To avoid distortions in food prices, the cost of this programme will be borne by the Treasury rather than by the consumer; to avoid distortions in production, a formula for distribution will be proposed which relates payments to grain acreage rather than to actual wheat production. The Government will assist further the position of farmers and fishermen through the implementation of several programmes. It proposes the establishment of new national marketing agencies and the implementation of a small farm development programme. The recent extensions of fisheries closing lines will permit the Government to engage more actively in the management of its marine resources so as to increase the supply of fish available to Canadian fishermen in the waters off our coasts.

Both the effectiveness and the quality of any programme for the provision of services to Canadians depends increasingly upon a harmonious fiscal relationship between the Federal government and the governments of the ten provinces. Legislation will be introduced, therefore, proposing the renewal and improvement of equalization arrangements, increasing to 100 percent the level of stabilization of provincial revenues, and a number of other items. These will include the administration on behalf of requesting provinces of succession duties and gift taxes, the extension for two years of the transfers to provinces respecting post-secondary education, the provision of a five-year revenue guarantee to provinces to protect their income tax revenues under the new system, and the sharing with provinces of the special tax on undistributed corporate income.

As a further protection against the isolation of individuals caused by economic deprivation, the fundamental reform of protective measures which commenced last year with the new Unemployment Insurance Act will continue. A new Canada Labour Code, reflecting the many representations received in past months, will be introduced as will important amendments to the Fair Employment Practices Act. The Canada Manpower programmes will be improved and additional steps will be taken to make the training and placement services adequate to the needs of specially disadvantaged people whose particular problems present challenges which cannot be met with the use of regular programme resources or techniques. For those persons seeking to further their education, the loan limits under the Canada Student Loans Act will be raised, permitting students to borrow more within a given year and increasing significantly the total amount available under the programme.

The isolation which a product of social injustice is less well understood than that which comes from economic denial. Nevertheless, its consequences dare not be ignored by any society. The irony of isolation in an urban surrounding cannot be resolved by any single act. One essential, however, is the provision of adequate housing of high standard to all Canadians. More dwelling units were started in 1971 than in any single year in our history, including a record number for lower income families. It is clear, however, that Canada's housing needs cannot be met only through increases in scale. What is required, and what the Government will be proposing, are fresh concepts, continuing research, and imagination in neighbourhood improvement with emphasis on the need for low cost housing.

In order to achieve our goal of full participation by all members of society, all barriers leading to isolation must be removed. We cannot invite respect for our laws and support for our institutions from persons to whom they are irrelevant or ineffective. Government activities must reflect the needs of all Canadians, not only the favoured. A giant step in this direction was taken with the adoption last session of tax reform legislation which spreads more evenly the burden of social services on those Canadians best able to bear it. Another step, and long overdue, consists of policies to ensure the equality of women in Canadian society. These will be announced this session.

Protective steps will be proposed in a number of areas of wide concern to Canadians-the non-medical use of drugs, compensation for victims of crime, and the protection of privacy. Progress toward more humane treatment of offenders will continue with further reforms in the penal and parole systems. Amendments will be proposed for reforms in the administration of the criminal law. The Government is committed as well to federal participation in legal aid subject to satisfactory cost-sharing and administrative details being worked out.

It is the view of the Government that the most important single factor in the attainment of individual dignity and active social involvement is the assurance of a secure income. Considerable progress towards the goal of a total income security programme for all Canadians is achieved in the new Family Income Security Plan bill which will be presented for your consideration. The emphasis in this plan is on protection and is consistent with the Government's belief in the strong sense of self-reliance of Canadians.

The pride with which Canadians regard this country and which inspires them to identify with it springs from many sources. Some of these are physical in nature, some cultural, still others are economic. Canadians find in the vast spaces of this land, in its rugged coasts, in its throbbing vitality and in its serene tranquility something of themselves. It is the intention of the Government that immense areas of Canada be preserved in their natural state for the enjoyment of this generation and of generations to come. For the first time some of the grandeur and the wilderness which is Canada's north will be guaranteed perpetual preservation through incorporation into the National Parks System. You will be asked to approve legislation which will create three new parks north of the 60th parallel, each as large and as spectacular as any in the world. These three parks, plus the seven new parks created since 1968, mean that for the first time in our history every province and territory will include within it a national park for the benefit of our people.

Companion legislation will be introduced to provide wildlife habitats and to protect certain endangered wildlife species.

While taking care to preserve for the future, we should, wherever possible, preserve and restore those achievements of the past which are an essential element in our self-understanding as a people. You will be asked to consider, therefore, a bill creating and endowing a corporation to be known as Heritage Canada which will go far to ensure the preservation of items and collections from Canada's past and to make these accessible for the enjoyment and understanding of Canadians in all parts of the country. Heritage Canada, complemented by a broadened National Museums policy, will demonstrate the achievements of our fore-fathers and their successes in overcoming physical isolation and in converting dreams into reality.

Still another form of isolation springs from indifferent communications services. It is a matter of concern to the Government that at this moment many communities do not receive the natior al broadcasting service and that some one million Canadians in 260 communities receive no television service in their own language. The Government proposes, therefore, that the C.B.C. be authorized to extend its services in a comprehensive fashion and to utilize the capabilities of Canada's pioneer satellite communications system to assure within a five year period that at least 98 percent of Canadians are served.

The standards against which a society is judged by others and by history are often those chosen by the society itself. The image it projects, the values to which it adheres, the treatment it accords the disadvantaged in its midst; these are matters for each society to determine, and in determining to be judged. In our relations with one another, in federal-provincial relations, in Canada's relations with other countries, our values are both guides and distinguishing features. Canada is committed to the betterment of life for all, to the resolution of differences by reason not force, to the practice of tolerance, to the acceptance of love and understanding as the most important of human traits. The Government, therefore, will continue to participate fully in international efforts for peace and for the well-being of people everywhere. It will continue to do what it can on behalf of the Canadian people to assist those who are afflicted by calamities, both natural and man-made.

The fluidity in world affairs marked by events in the past months and those expected in the near future present to us an opportunity to deepen and enrich our relationships with our old friends and to seek and strengthen friendships with others both within and without the councils and agencies of the United Nations. Isolation within the international community is as barren and damaging as is isolation within a domestic society. The visits to Canada in 1971 of such distinguished Heads of State and Government as the Presidents of Yugoslavia, Nauru and Niger, and the Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Ceylon, Ghana, Malaysia, Fiji, Senegal, and Israel illustrate the universality of Canada's attitude to the world.

Canada's lines of communication and understanding continue to stand open in all directions. In particular, our ties with our friends in the new Europe and our attachment to the United States remain of the greatest importance. A United States which is strong, dynamic and outward looking is vital to the success of Canada's international endeavours and to our ability to contribute to the well-being of fellow Commonwealth countries and of those states in receipt of Canadian economic assistance including the fellow members of 1'Agence de Cooperation culturelle et technique des pays francophones to whose important conference we acted with pride as host last autumn. The Government and all Canadians anticipate with considerable pleasure the visit to Canada this spring of the President of the United States and Mrs. Nixon.

Our age is marked by inconsistency. Within our societies, the trend all too often is toward increases in size and of impersonality in human relationships while on the planet itself the speed of communication has created a new intimacy among nations. In these circumstances, there is both challenge and opportunity for governments and for individuals. Canada is seized of the challenge. The Government pledges itself to turn the opportunities to the benefit of individual Canadians.
