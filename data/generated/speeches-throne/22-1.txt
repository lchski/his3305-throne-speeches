Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It is a pleasure for me to welcome you to the opening of the twenty-second parliament. This is a time when, if peace is maintained, we have every reason to look forward to the continuing development of this prosperous and happy nation.
The coronation of our beloved Queen was an occasion for universal rejoicing. Her devotion to duty, her personal charm and her happy family life have assured Her Majesty of a warm place in the hearts of all her subjects and have strengthened

our attachment to the crown and to the traditions of our constitutional system of government.
Following the legislation enacted during the last parliament, the changes in the royal style and titles have been proclaimed by Her Majesty.
Much remains to be done before there can be a permanent and durable peace in the world. My ministers therefore consider it would be unwise for the free nations to slacken our efforts to build up and maintain the necessary strength to deter aggression and they intend to continue to work to that end.
We have every reason for satisfaction that through the use for the first time of collective police action the objective of the United Nations in Korea has been substantially achieved. The aggressors have been driven back, the fighting has ceased and an armistice has been concluded. My government earnestly hopes that a political conference will ultimately succeed in restoring peace in Korea.
Canada has continued to contribute to those international projects which will promote human welfare and thereby remove some of the causes of unrest and dislocation. You will be asked to approve further assistance for relief and rehabilitation, for technical assistance and for continued participation in the Colombo plan.
The alliance of the North Atlantic nations has been effective thus far in preventing aggression in Europe. My government continues to regard the treaty as one of the foundation stones of Canada's external policy. The formation of the air division of the Royal Canadian Air Force in Europe is now completed. The brigade group of the Canadian Army is performing its role effectively in the integrated force. Canadian naval strength is increasing.
Canada's total volume of external trade has reached record levels. But dollar shortages in many countries have persisted and continue to create problems for some of our exporters. Another commonwealth conference with respect to financial and economic matters is to be held in Australia early in the new year.
Tariff concessions negotiated at Geneva in 1947, at Annecy in 1949, at Torquay in 1950 and 1951 under the general agreement on tariffs and trade have been extended for an additional period.
My ministers are convinced that nations can best achieve economic strength and security through more liberal trade and overseas investment policies and they are continuing their efforts to bring about the progressive reduction of trade restrictions.
At home we continue to enjoy general prosperity although there are some sectors of our economy which have been faced with difficulties. Our farmers have harvested the second largest wheat crop in Canadian history. Private capital Investment has reached levels never before attained. Employment is at high levels.
While more houses are being built this year than ever before, the growing population of Canada requires a continued expansion of housing. You will be asked to consider measures to increase and broaden the supply of mortgage money so that more people with moderate incomes will be able to find facilities to assist them to build their own homes.
A bill to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act to provide for appropriate compensation to farmers whose hogs suffered from cholera, will be placed before you.
The scheme initiated during the last parliament for insuring boats and certain gear has recently been improved and is helping to meet the hazards of the fishing industry. My government is giving particular attention to the development of markets for our fisheries and to the encouragement of more
Speech from the Throne modern methods in the Atlantic coast fisheries, particularly in the province of Newfoundland where the methods are in the greatest need of improvement.
The strategic importance of the northern part of Canada has increased greatly in recent years. Its place in the economy of Canada is steadily growing and will continue to expand in future. You will be asked to consider a bill to change the designation and orientation of the Department of Resources and Development and to define the responsibilities of the government with respect to the affairs of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, including the Arctic archipelago, and the welfare of the Eskimos.
You will be asked to amend the Pipe Lines Act to give the board of transport commissioners jurisdiction over all companies authorized to construct or operate interprovincial or international oil or gas pipe lines.
The New York state power authority has accepted a licence granted by the federal power commission in the United States for the development of the United States share of power in the international rapids section of the St. Lawrence river. It is hoped that litigation in the United States will not have the effect of delaying the construction of the project.
As further steps in helping to improve social welfare, co-ordinated plans for rehabilitation of disabled persons are being worked out with the provinces and a measure to facilitate the establishment nation-wide of a federal-provincial assistance program for totally disabled persons will be submitted for your consideration.
As provided by law you will be required to consider this year a complete revision of the Bank Act.
The bill for the complete revision of the Criminal Code which was not finally dealt with in the last parliament will be submitted for your consideration.
A committee of penal experts has been appointed to examine and report upon methods of parole and remission of sentences.
Other measures which will be placed before you for consideration include bills respecting the Canadian forces; the United Kingdom financial agreement; the Ontario-Manitoba boundary; the extension for another year of the emergency gold mining assistance: and bills to amend the Bank of Canada Act, the Municipal Grants Act, the Explosives Act. the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the Customs Act, the Excise Act, the Excise Tax Act, the Atomic Energy Control Act and certain veterans legislation. Members of the House of Commons:
You will be asked to make provision for all essential services including our national defence and the meeting of our obligations under the United Nations Charter and the North Atlantic Treaty.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence bless your deliberations and help us to come nearer to a true and lasting peace.
