Legislation respecting the Senate will be introduced.

To ensure that the redistribution of electoral districts is made objectively and impartially, you will be asked to approve a bill to establish an independent commission to recommend redistribution.

A measure will be placed before you to establish an Indian claims commission to investigate claims on the part of various tribes and bands that certain of their rights have been restricted or abrogated, and to make recommendations for the equitable and final settlement of such claims.

Economic activity in Canada has moved ahead sharply. This strong advance has resulted in more than 200,000 new jobs during the past twelve months. The objective of my government is to accelerate this pace of advance. This would mean the creation over the next five years of more than 1 million new jobs and a corresponding growth in gross national product and in production for both the export and domestic market, already at record levels.

Such high levels of activity have not prevented the emergence of foreign exchange difficulties similar to those which confronted Canada in crisis proportions in 1947, and to those which have affected other major trading nations more recently. In June my government found it necessary to put into immediate effect a comprehensive program to strengthen the country's exchange reserves. Since that time Canada's exchange reserves have increased substantially. It is my government's firm intention to remove the import surcharges included in this program as soon as circumstances permit.

My government will continue to take positive, constructive measures to strengthen Canada's balance of international payments. The recently stabilized exchange rate for the Canadian dollar has greatly helped Canadian producers in all parts of Canada both in the domestic and export markets. The new exchange rate is contributing as well to a large expansion in the Canadian tourist industry, which has also been aided by joint efforts of the federal and provincial governments.

Canada's development will continue to require imports of capital, and to this end my government will maintain a climate in Canada hospitable to foreign investment.

As one of my government's measures to develop the Canadian economy, maintain a high level of employment and strengthen the balance of payments, you will be asked to approve legislation establishing a national economic development board. This board would be broadly representative and would review and report upon the state of the economy and upon economic policies. It would also have the duty of recommending to the government particular projects or measures which it considers would be in the interest of national development, including projects which may require direct governmental participation by way of financial aid or otherwise.

The objective of my ministers is a balanced budget. This will require the exercise of restraint in respect of controllable spending and an increased concentration of available resources on essential national projects designed to ensure the expansion of the Canadian economy. Steps will be taken to improve further the efficiency of government operations. The report of the royal commission on government organization will be helpful in achieving this improvement of administration while maintaining the high status of the Canadian public service. A program of economies in government expenditures will be reflected in the revised estimates to be placed before you.

A royal commission has been established to review the whole field of federal taxation and its impact on the Canadian economy, and to recommend reforms and improvements.

The purposes of the fiscal measures to be placed before you at this session will be the creation of better employment opportunities for the Canadian people, the promotion of a high rate of economic growth, the strengthening of Canada's balance of international payments and the maintenance of stability in prices. New budget measures will be introduced to provide further solutions to long teirm problems.

My ministers will reintroduce the resolutions submitted in the last budget which had as its central purpose the encouragement of economic growth. This will include the production incentive provided to manufacturing and processing companies by cancelling one half of the tax on the first $50,000 of taxable income arising from increased sales and one quarter of the increased tax on any additional income arising from increased sales. It will also include the measure to grant to individuals and companies the right to charge petroleum drilling and exploration expenses against income from oil and gas production, and to permit certain expenditures made to acquire oil and gas rights to be deductible for tax purposes. The measure to allow a special tax credit in respect of provincial logging taxes will also be reintroduced in order to remove discrimination in the taxation of logging operations. Iron mining companies will be added to the list of companies which are exempt from the special tax on income earned in Canada by branches of non-resident corporations. The measure will also be reintroduced to increase by $50 per year the income tax deductions allowed for children.

My government intends to press forward in cooperation with Canadian industry to secure a greater and more rapid application of science to industrial production. You will be asked to approve the new tax incentive announced in the last budget for corporations undertaking increased expenditures on scientific research in Canada. Dramatic evidence of successful co-operation between Canadian science and industry has been given this week in the opening of Canada's first nuclear power generating station.

Canada's prosperity and growth must ultimately rest in large measure upon its exports. To achieve adequate export levels it will be necessary to increase further Canada's capacity to produce competitively and its ability to sell in export markets. The government's industrial programs are directed toward these ends. Its commercial policy negotiations have the objective of opening additional markets to Canadian producers in fair exchange for opportunities for others to sell in Canada. The vigorous campaign of export trade promotion will be expanded to enlarge the sales of Canadian products in foreign markets. You will be asked to provide the funds necessary for this increasing trade promotion work. Amendments to the Export Credits Insurance Act will also be placed before you, to double the insurance liability which the corporation may assume and to improve the arrangements for long term financing.

You will be asked to authorize the establishment of an Atlantic development board to advise on measures and projects that will promote the economic development of the Atlantic region of Canada.

Amendments will be requested in the Industrial Development Bank Act to enlarge still further this bank's important role in national development.

The prosperity of agriculture remains essential to the well-being of the entire Canadian economy. Canada is blessed this year with very large crops of good quality, and export markets for Canadian agricultural products have been greatly enlarged.

My ministers recognize that livestock is occupying a position of increasing importance in Canadian agriculture. They propose that a program

be instituted to ensure the availability of storage facilities and continuity of supplies of feed grain to match the expanding requirements for livestock production, particularly in the areas of British Columbia and eastern Canada where supplies of feed grain are normally deficient.

The program of rehabilitation and development of agricultural lands is proceeding actively and you will be asked to provide funds for it.

Legislation will be proposed to enlarge the funds of the Farm Credit Corporation, and allow greater flexibility in their use.

The need for training in agriculture and the present facilities have also been under review and as a sequel to these studies, a national conference on agricultural training is to be convened this fall.

The development and use of Canada's resources of energy must be a central feature of the program for national economic growth. The twenty fourth parliament has laid the groundwork for this in the National Energy Board Act and in other measures.

It is hoped that arrangements will soon be completed that will make it possible to submit for your approval the Columbia river treaty and the legislation required in parliament to implement it.

The national oil policy introduced by the government two years ago has brought about a gratifying increase in the production and sale of Canadian oil.

Studies will be continued, in co-operation with the provinces, in relation to the long distance high voltage transmission of electrical power and the development of potential sources of hydroelectric power with a view to the ultimate establishment of a national power grid, which will facilitate the orderly utilization of the hydroelectric potential of Canada in the interests of expanding Canadian development and progress. Discussions are in progress with the government of Manitoba in respect to studies of the Nelson river system.

My ministers have come to the conclusion that large scale, long term contracts for the export of power surplus to Canada's needs, present and potential, should now be encouraged in order to expedite the development of major power projects in Canada which are too large to be supported by the domestic market. Such exports can also strengthen our balance of payments.

In recognition of the important role of transportation in the Canadian economy, you will be asked to approve measures to give effect to recommendations of the royal commission on transportation which has now completed its comprehensive analysis of the Canadian railway problem. These changes are intended to remove the need for general horizontal freight rate increases which have borne so heavily in the past upon certain areas and groups of producers. You will also be asked to provide for an extension of the Freight Rates Reduction Act and the other interim railway subsidies provided by appropriation.

Amendments will be proposed to the Canada Shipping Act to preserve for Canadian vessels the coasting trade in the St. Lawrence and great lakes area. Funds will be requested to implement the program of shipbuilding subsidies announced some months ago.

You will be asked to provide for the continuation of the winter works program to assist municipalities in meeting seasonal unemployment.

Far reaching changes are taking place in manpower requirements in Canadian industries as a result of automation, other technological developments and world competitive pressures. A measure will be placed before you designed to assist employers, workers and their organizations in meeting the impact of industrial change.

My government will also place before you legislation to provide safeguards against accidents and hazards in works and undertakings within the federal fields of jurisdiction.

The committee inquiring into matters relating to the unemployment insurance fund is expected to submit its report this autumn. Following consideration of this report, appropriate measures will be placed before you.

In order to permit the introduction of a national system of contributory old age pensions with disability and survivor benefits, an amendment to the British North America Act is required. The governments of all provinces except Quebec and Newfoundland have concurred in such an amendment. My government is prepared to recommend to you the approval of an address to Her Majesty requesting the amendment when the concurrence of these remaining provinces has been received.

As pension plans have become ever more widely extended in Canadian business, it has been increasingly recognized that measures are essential to protect the interests of those affected and in particular to ensure that the benefits earned are portable when workers move from job to job. Provincial legislation would be required for this purpose in most cases, and several provinces are considering proposals of this nature. My government will be prepared to place before you complementary legislation to deal with industries under federal jurisdiction when adequate progress has been made by provinces.

A measure will be placed before you to authorize the establishment of a national council of welfare to make more fully effective the action of both federal and provincial governments in this field.

You will be asked to approve amendments to the Food and Drugs Act to provide for more effective control of the distribution and sale of drugs in the interests of the public health.

You will be asked to enact legislation to provide for the establishment of a national medical research council.

Legislation will be reintroduced to authorize the payment by federal crown corporations of certain provincial commodity taxes and fees.

Legislation will be proposed on university grants which will include authorization of payment of the higher grants announced some months ago and will provide alternative arrangements where supplementary provincial grants are made in lieu of federal grants.

A bill will be introduced to authorize a revision and codification of all federal statutes.

Bills will be introduced to amend the Judges Act, the Aeronautics Act, the Bankruptcy Act, the Coal Production Assistance Act and the Currency, Mint and Exchange Fund Act, and other statutes.

Members of the House of Commons:

You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on the services and payments approved by parliament.

You will be asked to abolish closure and to reestablish the special committee on procedure of the house.

Honourable Members of the Senate:

Members of the Commons:

I pray that God in His wisdom may enlighten you in the discharge of your duty toward our country.
